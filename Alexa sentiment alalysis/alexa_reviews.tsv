0	Love my Echo!	1
1	Loved it!	1
2	Sometimes while playing a game, you can answer a question correctly but Alexa says you got it wrong and answers the same as you.  I like being able to turn lights on and off while away from home.	1
3	I have had a lot of fun with this thing. My 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs, i control the lights and play games like categories. Has nice sound when playing music as well.	1
4	Music	1
5	I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can‚Äôt wait to see what else it can do.	1
6	Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet.	1
7	I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.	1
8	looks great	1
9	Love it! I‚Äôve listened to songs I haven‚Äôt heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It‚Äôs great!	1
10	I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly.	1
11	I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times	1
12	I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!	1
13	Love, Love, Love!!	1
14	Just what I expected....	1
15	I love it, wife hates it.	1
16	Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.	1
17	We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.	1
18	We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound	1
19	I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)	1
20	Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.	1
21	We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying.	1
22	Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it‚Äôs not intrusive to look at.	1
23	I love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask	1
24	I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation.	1
25	Amazing product	1
26	I love my Echo. It's easy to operate, loads of fun.It is everything as advertised. I use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test Alexa's knowledge.	1
27	Sounds great!! Love them!	1
28	Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better.	1
29	Just like the other one	1
30	Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good	1
31	I like it	1
32	She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa ‚Äúlearn‚Äù Tasha‚Äôs birthday.  Or Alexa ‚Äúlearn‚Äù my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great	1
33	The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.	1
34	This device is awesome!	1
35	I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.	1
36	Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn‚Äôt able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube.	1
37	Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo	1
38	This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is.	1
39	This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!	1
40	My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities	1
41	My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running.	1
42	So far so good	1
43	Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.	1
44	Great	1
45	Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.	1
46	It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals.	0
47	Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.	1
48	I love you so much	1
49	No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify ‚Äúplus/prime/etc‚Äù account.  So you must pay to play ‚Äúyour‚Äù music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is üëçüèª .	1
50	Excelente, lo unico es que no esta en espa√±ol.	1
51	I'm still learning how to use it, but so far my Echo is great! The sound is actually much better than I was expecting.	1
52	Works as you‚Äôd expect and then some. Also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.	1
53	The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.	1
54	like google better	1
55	Just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it.	1
56	Works as advertised. Very easy to setup. Still learning what this can do.	1
57	Great sound and easy to set up.	1
58	Love Alexa, bought others for friends	1
59	Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs	1
60	üòç	1
61	Love being able to listen to music easily. Still learning all the features available	1
62	Did t really know what I could use this device for. Used it for a few things, but need an overview	1
63	Love this just wish it had a built in hub	1
64	I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!	1
65	How easy if was to set up.	1
66	Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.	1
67	You‚Äôre all I need...na na nana!	1
68	Does everything as expected and more.	1
69	I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so I cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good.	1
70	Great sound in a small package‚Äîeasy to set up and use; fun to own.	1
71	Works and sounds great.	1
72	The sound is amazing and many collections of all music	1
73	Setting up	1
74	She doesn‚Äôt always listen	1
75	It‚Äôs awesome	1
76	I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I‚Äôm hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many ‚Äúapps‚Äù you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I‚Äôm looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located.	1
77	The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!	1
78	I LIKE IT ALL	1
79	I love it. It does everything	1
80	I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I'm not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! I'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!	1
81	I like it and still learning how to use it.	1
82	Great technology!! Can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!	1
83	I purchased an echo dot for my husband for Fathers Day.  He uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the Echo (2nd Generation), It was a no-brainer.  Best gift ever!	1
84	Works fine!!	1
85	 	1
86	Clear music	1
87	Fun to use, good sound quality	1
88	The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.	1
89	Works great, but I don't think Amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1) Have Prime AND 2) Buy an Echo.	1
90	Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!	1
91	The speaker sounds really good	1
92	Good sound works well	1
93	Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.	1
94	Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.	1
95	We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet.	1
96	Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!	1
97	Love the Echo !!! I love the size, material and speaker quality. I have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat. Next is Echo Dot for bedroom. There is a lot more to do with Echo that you think. Traffic, Weather, Trivia, etc.	1
98	Love it!	1
99	The entire family loves Alexa Echo. She‚Äôs now a part of this family.	1
100	Great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  WOW -- family fun and homework help.  Talking with other grandchildren,who also have an Echo, is a HUGE bonus.  Can't wait to learn more and more and more	1
101	Love it!	1
102	awesome thing, love Alexa	1
103	It worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound. It is perfect for my classroom!	1
104	LOVE, LOVE this new little gadget.  Has  made our lives so much easier.  it's like having our own personal secretary living here in the home.  We hardly need our CD's anymore, since ALEXA plays everything we need.  Going to get the Alexa DOTS soon for more rooms.  Thanks!!	1
105	The speaker is of surprising quality. Happy with the purchase.	1
106	Very easy to set up. Works wonderful and I love it!!	1
107	I'm really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it's coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.	1
108	It‚Äôs still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don‚Äôt get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it‚Äôs great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it‚Äôs even better.	1
109	The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.	1
110	Great device, responsive and helpful	1
111	Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose	0
112	i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that.	1
113	Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.	1
114	Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.	1
115	4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product.	1
116	Works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn‚Äôt be happier!	1
117	It's Alexa.... what else can you say	1
118	Upgraded from my lilttle echo dot. Happy with sound	1
119	Excellent product, set up with ease as well.	1
120	I've had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I'm happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.	1
121	I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.	1
122	wonderful product and fast delivery!	1
123	Initially harder to set up called tech wasn‚Äôt that knowledgeable now working great.	1
124	It was very easy to set up and my family love it‚Äôs!	1
125	Has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.	1
126	How did I live this long without the Echo . You get to enjoy any music style  just my asking Alexa . Going to up-greade to the wireless . Love the Echo . Love you too Alexa .	1
127	Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.	1
128	Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I‚Äôm across the room or busy doing something else.	1
129	So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well.	1
130	Love our echo	1
131	I love it,she is very helpful. I use her for remembering things and sleep. You can ask her just about anything. I have only had her for about a week so still learning her.	1
132	It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it.	1
133	I love having an Alexa!	1
134	So far I like it ü§ì	1
135	I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.	1
136	Still love it	1
137	Love it	1
138	I love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound.	1
139	I just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.	1
140	I have had for only a week, so I am still learning all that Alexa can do.  It is a learning process.  I love the music I can call up any time.  I listen to podcasts and radio stations.  I have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which I love.  I don‚Äôt have to search for paper and pencil.  Getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  The sound is good.  I am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the Echo is fine for me.  This afternoon I am going to try ‚Äúdropping in‚Äù.on my son when he gets home.  Going to surprise him.	1
141	Not much features.	0
142	Great sound quality, great features, great product. Multi room music is very cool.	1
143	Cool	1
144	Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.	1
145	it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself	1
146	I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn't be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.	1
147	I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if I am not very specific about the title.	1
148	I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.	1
149	The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.	1
150	Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music.	1
151	Love it	1
152	awesome.understands my kids	1
153	We were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. How nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. Looking forward to exploring other options with this device.	1
154	Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.	1
155	I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT, I really love having the music.	1
156	i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries.	1
157	This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!	1
158	"During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my ""smart"" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!"	1
159	Versatile and fun !!!	1
160	Works great! Killer speaker! My wife and son love it.	1
161	We regret waiting so long to purchase this item. We are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.	1
162	Stopped working after 2 weeks ,didn't follow commands!? Really fun when it was working?	0
163	so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app	1
164	It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.  Do you have a chart showing the language I need to use?	1
165	Easy to set up.	1
166	I like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality I expected	1
167	A great investment. Alexa has helped me out and made me laugh.	1
168	Yet another Exho for our home and love them all!!!	1
169	I love it, I can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz, not easy to find on local radio. Sound is good and I can stop it with a voice command if I get a phone call.	1
170	Good Value	1
171	Super easy set up and am loving our new Echo!	1
172	Whats not to like about this speaker.  Just ask Alexa	1
173	BEST father's day gift. Dad joked to my mom that Alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.	1
174	Great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  Tunes and information instantly available.  Slowly learning more features.	1
175	Sound quality	1
176	Sad joke. Worthless.	0
177	Entertainment	1
178	Very good quality	1
179	Works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability	1
180	Loved it till someone stoled it. Can't afford to replace it yet but I am going too.	1
181	Alexa rocks	1
182	Got this as a gift and love it. I never would have bought one for myself, but now that I have it.... Allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music ; that's worth it in and of itself.  Also, gives new's briefs and tells jokes.	1
183	 	1
184	My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her ‚Äúno‚Äù for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It‚Äôs that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you‚Äôre going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou‚Äôll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn‚Äôt live without.	1
185	Love it!! Great product!!!	1
186	Easy set up very user friendly	1
187	Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa.	0
188	I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.	1
189	Everything	1
190	I like the interaction of asking questions. I don‚Äôt like that I can‚Äôt ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.	1
191	Supberb sound! Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.	1
192	I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!	1
193	Love it!  So do the grandkids!!	1
194	"So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or ""skills"", but getting the hang of it."	1
195	Works as advertised	1
196	I love it!	1
197	Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won‚Äôt respond or says she doesn‚Äôt recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won‚Äôt respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it‚Äôs a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too.	1
198	Like everything about it. The music, the trivia games, the weather.	1
199	As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.	1
200	A great device	1
201	I owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since English is her second language she was born in korea. But the sound from the echo is superb. So we‚Äôll keep it..	1
202	Love this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!	1
203	Very nice!  I'm impressed - wish she had more to say though.	1
204	Love the product. Nice to have easy access to so much info!!!	1
205	It's got great sound and bass but it doesn't work all of the time. Its still hot or miss when it recognizes things	0
206	We are still discovering all that the Echo can do.	1
207	Amazing paroduct	1
208	Good hearing range and sound quality. It was a bit complicated to set up and she doesn't quite understand me a lot even when I am speaking slowly and clearly but I love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system.	1
209	speaker sounds good	1
210	Absolutely love!!	1
211	The best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  There isn‚Äôt anything I dislike.	1
212	We're thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We're enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We've added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.	1
213	Home entertainment	1
214	Very cool product. Easy to setup, fun to use and sound quality is much better than I anticipated.	1
215	Love these,  great sound... easy to connect and use...	1
216	Doesn't work with my fairly new smart TV, but that's mainly the TV manufacturers(LG) fault due to not supporting anything older than TVs from this year. My smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well. Speakers sound great and works very well.	1
217	Great sound from a little speaker	1
218	We enjoy it	1
219	 	1
220	Cool	1
221	Good quality, great sound quality	1
222	Works perfectly	1
223	Great product. Sometimes Alexa does not understand some commands for my Fire TV. All in all, this is a fabulous speaker.	1
224	Love my Echo great sound very smart!	1
225	Sure did !! Love it !!	1
226	plays great	1
227	Works absolutely great	1
228	Very amazing product. Great sound quality.	1
229	Best thing I've invested in in a while thank you so much üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ	1
230	I am extremely impressed with this item. Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can't tell it even has one. works great. Didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It's not a BOSE but it's more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can't wait to get for my classroom too! It's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it.	1
231	I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!	1
232	Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!	1
233	I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. She isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again.	0
234	I like everything about it !!!	1
235	Liked 100%	1
236	Never had ANY issue with buying use electronics as long as I get the GOOD or LIKE NEW. Just read the comment to see why it is used.	1
237	Our family really loves this new Echo	1
238	bought for my wife she loves it	1
239	Fun just got it today now my I pod will go in my car and I will use this is the house.	1
240	Like it to do more	1
241	This is our third echo. Worth every penny. It's like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc.	1
242	Listen music and set timer	1
243	I received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!	1
244	Good sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!	1
245	Purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.	1
246	This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller.	1
247	Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!	1
248	I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don't consider it an upgrade.	1
249	I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them	1
250	I‚Äôm having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I‚Äôm not exactly tech smart. I‚Äôm sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I‚Äôve been using it mostly for music.	1
251	Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I'm too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.	1
252	Enjoyed entire echo experience	1
253	Easy to set up.	1
254	The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.	1
255	We are loving Ours very much	1
256	I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you	1
257	Very pleased with the Echo 2nd Generation. It is so nice to have Alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven‚Äôt discovered.	1
258	"I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a ""smart home"". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!"	1
259	Easy to setup. Love all the things she does.	1
260	Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!	1
261	I already have an Alexa and with Amazon find today I could not resist getting an echo also. It is the best thing I ever did, I use them on each side of the house! And couldn't be happier!	1
262	Arrived as expected.	1
263	Bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! Don't forget to buy a charger when ordering, it's a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard.	1
264	Terrific	1
265	Love my Echo	1
266	It‚Äôs smaller than the original. Looks nicer too.	1
267	Works great!	1
268	My husband and I are what I would call &#34;late adopters&#34; when it come to technology, but we decide we would try and Echo to serve primarily as a music source.  Wow, were we amazed and the great sound!  We've also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking Alexa.  I may even buy one for my elderly Dad - I think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us!	1
269	I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels, plays iHeartRadio and Pandora , adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights.	1
270	I have been wanting one of these for a while now.  Bought on Prime Day and absolutely love it.	1
271	We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.	1
272	See subject line.  Love it	1
273	Love it!	1
274	Very easy setup.	1
275	I was hesitant to buy the echo because I have the echo Dot and it seems good enough. The echo is the same except the sound quality, which I really didn't feel I needed. However, I am so glad I got it. What a difference! The sound really is far superior to the Echo Dot! Now I can listen to The Greatest Showman with a little more power!	1
276	Sound quality is great. Still learning about all the different things I can do with it. FUN!!!	1
277	Got a good deal and works great with Prime.  Setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service.  Has worked great with nice sound from small speaker.	1
278	I love it!!	1
279	Works great! Perfect for my office!	1
280	Love it--- have one inside house and one by our pool now . Just as good as Bose speakers around house -	1
281	easy to use--amazing	1
282	Nice product A+	1
283	We love our Echo! We were totally amazed at the speaker quality. Only bummed we didn‚Äôt buy two since we got it on Prime day!	1
284	Very responsive. Great sound quality for its size.	1
285	It's so efficient and amazing!  How COOL!  We all use it often every day...	1
286	I‚Äôm impressed with the quality of sound that the Echo has, it‚Äôs definitely comparable to my Bose Mini. I only gave 4 stars because I can‚Äôt use my Apple Music account.	1
287	Technology in such a small device. The price was good too! The sound is amazing! A must have feature for any home!	1
288	Mainly use it for the music but I‚Äôm learning more all the time.  Really nothing bad to say about it	1
289	I replaced my 1st gen, was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same sound...I was wrong.  If anything it's the same volume, and more clear.  Good product.	1
290	Great addition to my Echo Plus!	1
291	the best	1
292	Love the feature to play music in every room with multiple Echos.	1
293	I love Alexa!  I am surprised how much I use her.	1
294	I use this product for enjoyment and I just love it	1
295	Easy to use and has great sound...It was a great purchase at a great price.	1
296	Very easy to set up and have no issues.	1
297	This unit add much pleasure to our Echo Plus.  We now can have music and information through our home. (or just in one room)	1
298	It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.	1
299	Too difficult to set up.  It keeps timing out before you can enter the password	0
300	Just getting use to using the Echo. Used it for shopping lists, listening to music and as a timer. Working great so far.	1
301	Very cool and lots of fun! Used for a week and still learning its capabilities.	1
302	Love it, love it!!!!!!!!	1
303	Love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps	1
304	I use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information	1
305	it's great for music, a little hard to figure out how it works.	1
306	This was given to my 7 year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad. He loves it, ask Alexa anything she has the answer, plus it‚Äôs good for homework. So I purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when I‚Äôm getting ready for work. I listen to music at 4am and the base it‚Äôs metro booming.. Replacement for my clock radio, plus I have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock..	1
307	Very impressed with look, clarity of sound and color.	1
308	Alexa is amazing! Great speaker.	1
309	Still getting used to Alexa, don't have her connected to our TV yet or other things right now use her for music and information, which she is great!!	1
310	Works and sounds great! My house is barely 1100sf, and I have this sitting on my kitchen counter. I can hear it, and speak to it from any room. Lots of functionality still to discover.	1
311	I have had pure fun with my echo.  Weather, jokes, news briefing, and music but still so much more to use it for.  A lot of fun for the money.	1
312	Use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home	1
313	Love it, still learning, makes a lot of things easier, like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask Alexa to turn the light off.	1
314	Bought this for my daughter when she turned 9.  She loves it!!  I especially like the calling feature since she doesn‚Äôt have a cell phone.  She loves playing music and dancing and with Amazon music she can play all her favorite songs ...... sometimes over and over and over again lol!	1
315	We got this as a wedding gift and haven‚Äôt discovered all of its features yet. Will update. Playing music is great though!	1
316	I am impressed with the sound quality.	1
317	Very pleased with my purchase of Echo Smart Speaker - love the fact that I can play music of different genre's whenever I want.Had some trouble at first with the WI FI, but it is now working.	1
318	My  wife & I enjoy the ease of playing our music. The games are fun & entertaining, I look forward to adding more smart products to my home.	1
319	This is my second Echo and I love how it helps me in the kitchen. I can set timers, listen to the news, prepare grocery lists, and get great music.	1
320	The sound quality is good just wish alexa could answer more questions	1
321	This is my second Echo, I have the Dot but the speaker is weak so I purchased this and for listening to music the speaker is great.	1
322	great sound	1
323	Great	1
324	We really only use this as a speaker to stream music. We‚Äôve had it 7 months and it‚Äôs just kinda useless.	1
325	Once set up very user friendly. Set-up wasn't as user friendly as I'd hoped.. The alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers. My wife and I are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install Alexa, but if my son wasn't supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using Alexa yet.	1
326	Very easy set up. Really enjoying it	1
327	The echo doesn‚Äôt come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it, makes it quite inconvenient.	1
328	more compact and a bit better than the original	1
329	I love it pretty cool.	1
330	I having it in my living room. Music sounds really good in my living room . I can hear it upstairs.	1
331	This is a great product!  Set up was easy.  Sound is wonderful.	1
332	So far I like it.  I bought it just for some music though, and it sounds pretty good.	1
333	Love it	1
334	Love it.	1
335	Glad I bought this.	1
336	Like, all types of fun,music, and more	1
337	I like the volume up and down on the top so I can turn it down quickly.	1
338	Beyond my capabilities to program. Grandkids lve it	1
339	I love my new echo.  It gives me hours of music and help with other things.It was difficult for me to set it up,  I had to have help from a Tekkie	1
340	Almost as good as my Bose. Love the whole house music.	1
341	Alexa hardly came on..	0
342	Easy setup using the app, which was also easy to install on my phone.  The sound quality while for listening to music on Pandora is wonderful!!	1
343	I‚Äôm still learning how to use the Echo, but so far I love it!	1
344	Works awesome!	1
345	Works great.	1
346	From such a small speaker it sounds great	1
347	Great sound for the size and the prize!! And of course....Alexa!	1
348	if you don't have an Echo you definitely need one	1
349	Great device.  Seems to work better than the 1st generation!	1
350	Item no longer works after just 5 months of use. Will not connect to wifi and unresponsive to reset requests.	0
351	I love the Echo Dot. So easy. So fun. I get to drop in on my Grandaughter who lives about 2000 miles away. Sounds like she is right next to me.	1
352	Works great no different than the new ones	1
353	This one's going in the kitchen for timer/music duty.	1
354	Love it but the volume could definitely use a boost. If it had better built in speaker's, would definitively be a 5 star. They thought ahead and put  an audio auxiliary input, so I bought a dedicated speaker for the Echo. Proved to be best way to go.	1
355	Works just fine.	1
356	Works great! Looks brand new! Love my new echo dot. I will be getting them for all the main rooms in the house.	1
357	For a refurbished item.. It works like its new... Which I love... Easy set up,  which I love. The only issue is the volume,  if you are listening while relaxing its fine,  but if you are expecting to do anything else,  I recommend  purchasing a speaker.	1
358	But not very loud	1
359	This is our 2nd one and we love it!	1
360	So i am not sure how i feel about the echo dot, it's so many things that i need to get used to you have to ask her the right questions or she won't understand you.	1
361	This thing barely works. You have to select 3rd party apps to do stuff you'd think it could do out of the box. I'm sending mine back asap. Waste of money.	0
362	Gift for my man. He doesn‚Äôt like that you have to plug it in and the pictures do not show the cord. Would prefer it cordless. Still works though for the purpose we bought it.	1
363	This is our 5th Amazon Echo device.  We have purchased refurbished before and been satisfied, this time is no different.  You can't tell this from brand new, and the price was $10 cheaper.  Our Echo's wake us up, keep timers, play music for us, act as encyclopedias, turn our lights on and off and so much more.	1
364	This small echo dot is amazing the sounds that come out are great.it changes my nest thermostat,and my Phillips hue lights.without leaving my chair.	1
365	We talk to her all the time for songs and just because we can . There aren‚Äôt dislikes about this device.	1
366	I‚Äôm never disappointed with amazons technology.	1
367	Worked as promised.	1
368	I returned 2 Echo Dots & am only getting refund for 1. I returned 2 in one package. I want my refunds for both of them. They are in the same package. Can you not see them both???!!!	0
369	not working	0
370	Has weird pauses in her speech pattern that are not present in my other echo devices.	1
371	I sure love Alexa!  LOL!  Thank you!  Great price and product!	1
372	It works	1
373	I'm an Echo fan but this one did not work	0
374	 	0
375	Bought for my bathroom to listen when I'm in the shower.  Love it.	1
376	Doesn't always respond when spoken to with promp word. I thought it would connect to my echo upstairs and use it like an intercom haven't been able to do that.	0
377	Fast shipping and works well	1
378	I Love it!!!!	1
379	LOVE LOVE LOVE my new and free assistant!  :)	1
380	Six words, &#34;Alexa, tell me a poop joke.&#34;	1
381	It worked for a month or so then it stopped. I've tried everything to try and make it work but nothing is working. I want a refund	0
382	Poor quality. Gave it away.	0
383	Refurbished is the way to go. My Echo works just like new.	1
384	love it	1
385	We have five of them. Need I say more?	1
386	The speakers arent too loud.. alexa is great though. Besides that naw	1
387	It works great and sounds good!	1
388	Never could get it to work. A techie friend looked at it for me and said the adapter wasn't strong enough to power it and that it looked like it had been bought at a dollar store. So, I am going to replace the adapter and hope it works then.	0
389	Almost like having Star Trek in your home!  Fun to try and outsmart !	1
390	This was an add on for my echo system, the refurbished product works like new!	1
391	Great for my office. I use this daily in many ways, to include spelling for me and background music.	1
392	Awesome. I love Alexa.	1
393	I wasn't sure I really wanted one of these, but now that I have it, it is extremely useful.  Get one, you'll love it!	1
394	Initially, this echo dot worked very well. Over time, the dot stopped responding to 'alexa' unless you were within one foot of it yelling. The other echos/echo dots in other rooms would respond without a response from this echo dot. Would not recommend buying refurbished.	0
395	Great Product fast shipping	1
396	I bought an echo dot that had been refurbished but its stops whatever function its performing quite often, doesn't wake up every time, randomly turns on but does nothing. Do not buy a refurbished Echo dot.	0
397	Perfect works great no problems with it being refurbished.	1
398	Dont trust this....	0
399	Perfect condition! I love my echo	1
400	Love it. Beautiful experience especially if hooked to smart lighting and other accessories.	1
401	We just got this within the last couple of weeks, from what we can tell no issues! My son wanted and &#34;alexa&#34; for his 6th birthday so she could tell him jokes, he could ask her questions and to listen to music she does all of that and more. We all enjoy this one so much that I just bought a second one this week during Prime Deals Day!	1
402	Divertido	1
403	Great product and works great	1
404	Bought this for the guest room.  It's a radio, alarm clock, information‚Äã center and so much more.	1
405	Great buy. Bought this to go with my Echo and love it. The speaker isn‚Äôt the best for music but works great in a kitchen for timers or alarms.	1
406	 	0
407	Works perfect. Save a few bucks and buy the refurbished. Looks brand new.	1
408	Looks and works perfect. Glad I got a good deal.	1
409	Just as good as the new one I bought but $10.00 less.	1
410	I love it works very well	1
411	everything perfect	1
412	Good price. Prompt shipping. Has been working flawlessly.	1
413	I love you, Alexa!	1
414	There's room for improvement on this. For the price, I cannot complain too much. I can still complain however, the audio is terrible. This is kind of like listening to a speak-n-spell from the 80s.	1
415	Iove it I bought it for my son because he wanted it and it‚Äôs awesome	1
416	It's an echo, and it works.  For the price it's great deal. Have had no issues with it.  As with all dots, the speaker is a bit tinny, but good for a second unit, or if you are like me, you can attach it to an external speaker for more sound.Good buy	1
417	Thanks	1
418	I wanted to use these as a radio and intercom as we get terrible fm reception where i live.  The speech recognition software is horrible.  My wife and i both are native Americans whose language is English she is from the north i am from Texas  neither have an accent from our birth area and yet it does not do a good job understanding us.  We bought two they do the same thing.  Additionally wifi reception was poor to marginal. I had to buy Wifi range extender for office and the other is ten feet from our router.  Both had problems Switched them around no difference.  So it they are now disconnected dust collectors.	0
419	This is my third Dot. They all work perfectly and I use each one multiple times a day. Absolutely love them.	1
420	Item has never worked. Out of box it is broken. Spent several days trying to get it working and running same &#34;fixes&#34; from Amazon. The only thing accomplished is I will never order another refurbished device.	0
421	I already have the echo plus.  Bought this one for my bedroom.  Love the functions.	1
422	Simple set up.  Music everywhere.	1
423	Worked just like a brand new Dot ---so I am very satisfied.	1
424	Great product but returning for new Alexa Dot.  Refurbished is already giving me problems with connection.	0
425	We have a few echos already. Went for this one in refurbished to save a few bucks. It works great. I love this new generation one because it has a rubber bottom - nice.	1
426	I love the fact, that I can unplug it, and take it to my basement when I want do laundry.	1
427	Refurbished but just as good as the new ones that I've bought.	1
428	Good as new	1
429	Granddaughter loves it	1
430	The price is great.  Was having trouble with it hearing me from across a room, but after moving it to another spot, it seems to be working fine.  Will buy some more. Want 1 in every room.	1
431	We have set up alexa to blue tooth speakers and enjoy listening to music outdoors.  Can't wait to try more new stuff using Alexa!	1
432	Thanks	1
433	Works great!	1
434	&#34;NEVER BUY CERTIFIED AND REFURBISHED ECHO DOT &#34; I bought a &#34;Certified and Refurbished &#34; Echo Dot. This unit is very poor in receiving command and sometimes it does not even acknowledge the command. Never buy a refurbished Echo dot. The unit I received was probably never was certified and refurbished as indicated. I also bought a new ECHO dot, it works perfectly.Very disappointed !!!!	0
435	Started here with Amazon productsAnd I regret nothing is been absolutely great journey and my products continue to improve my day-to-day life	1
436	Have now used for several months without problem.	1
437	This is my first smart device and I will surely be buying other devices that will be compatible with this one.	1
438	Love	1
439	Love it just as good as a new one	1
440	Have had an larger echo for some time and love it. Bought this one for another portion of the house since we have several wifi home devices and we wanted to voice control them from all over the house.	1
441	Love the product.  Use to turn on my lights and answer some quick questions.	1
442	A great buy	1
443	Was Leary about refurbished but work great.	1
444	Very puny sound, but works great.	1
445	Great	1
446	Exactly like new, can tell the difference from my new dot I got prior to this one, works perfectly. LOVE Alexa	1
447	Works perfect no wear and tear on the device I love Alexa working on making my home smart üòÇ	1
448	Works good	1
449	The only thing I don't like is it shuts off by itself other than that it works great	1
450	Excellent product, mint condition for a refurbished unit - you would never know it's been refurbished!	1
451	Already owning a couple of Echos, I was frustrated that I couldn‚Äôt also use them as intercoms. Finally Amazon enables the ‚Äúdrop-in‚Äù feature so now I can use my Echos to reach out to family in remote parts of the house (and teenagers who insist they never heard me yelling at them to come down to dinner).As for its other features, we mainly use our Echos for the standard stuff: playing music, setting alarms, answering questions, etc. It's not the life-changing home device Amazon would have you believe, but it is convenient to have around. This refurb saved me a few bucks, looks and works the same as the other brand-new ones.	1
452	Love it was worried about the refurbished part at first but this being my first echo. It is awesome have used it for everything my lights since I work nights and shopping as well as for my spotify. And planning on getting it for my parents to help them out for everyday things we take for granted when we are young... I would recommend this to everyone!!!!	1
453	Love Alexa hope have her in every room soon.	1
454	The simplicity of use and setting up.	1
455	This is great! Got one for my Gazebo and one upstairs.	1
456	Works great, never had any issues.	1
457	Does everything I have asked it.	1
458	Works great ..good sound	1
459	I use this Echo to listen to music as well as a sort-of research tool. It can answer a variety of questions. I would like if the volume could go just a little bit louder, but I can't complain.I also believe it should have an internal power source. In order to use the Echo, it must be plugged in at all times using the universal charging cord. It would be nice to use the Echo Dot on the go without having to buy the other product.	1
460	Love it!  Great fun!	1
461	Love it!	1
462	outstanding I use all the time....works just like they say	1
463	saving $10 is always nice and my son always says that buying refurbished means your are getting a new device or product for less, because it has been run through a diagnostics again and everything has been corrected.	1
464	Works perfectly, Alexa turns on and off my lights, my tv, roomba!	1
465	Never would know it was refurbished.	1
466	So far so good	1
467	Looks and performs as new.  No complaints!	1
468	goes great with our echo	1
469	Works great just like the new one that i already had.	1
470	This item did not work. Certified refurbished should mean it works as advertised. Instead this item crashed as soon as I turned it on and plugged it in. When trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot, it crashed, over and over. Not only would it disconnect but the orange light would freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light. Alexa would tell me it‚Äôs ready to connect and freeze mid sentence. Tried holding the action button for 5 seconds and it didn‚Äôt do anything. Returning immediately and hope they actually fix this item when the next buyer purchases it.	0
471	Very fast service,  got what I ordered. Thank you	1
472	Love it even though I‚Äôm still trying to figure out all the other things I can do with this item it works great with my phone.	1
473	None	0
474	I have 2 Echos, one I bought brand new and the other is a refurbished one.Honestly, I can't tell the difference in performance and looks.	1
475	A GREAT PRODUCT...once we learned how to work it...this thing is awesome!!!	1
476	It works	1
477	Does not work all the time	0
478	Love it. Though, wish it was portable.	1
479	of course!	1
480	You could not tell this was refurbished. Works Excellent. I would highly recommended instead of purchasing new.	1
481	I got this for my mom . She loves it !	1
482	I love my echo dot! Looks brand new and works perfect! Very satisfied.	1
483	Same as new	1
484	A small problem out of the box, but a rep from Amazon called and walked me through a reset process which solved my issues. I was shocked to get a response so quickly and a real effort was made (including follow up email) to get this thing working. I have 6 now (and one google clone) and the more I use it, and learn about it, the more I like it (them). I also plan to install one in my car, boat and garage. Alexa is my new best friend!?!? (lol)I think GF is worried that if Alexa learns to cook, her time will be limited...	1
485	I love my Alexa Dot. I play games with my son, ask how the weather Is and I love that she works with my Amazon Fire Tv.	1
486	I like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart TV if I ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if I ask you to change the channel it does or doesn't sometimes I have to reset it I don't know if it's because it's refurbished but it's okay it's just not what I expected	1
487	So far the certified refurbished Echo Dot works well. It was a little confusing to have a green ring on the Echo Dot and not 100% know why it was there. Asked Alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in. But that was not the case. Took about 10 minutes to figure out it was a notification that I had a delivery from amazon. I believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification, but on my refurbished Echo Dot it was Green and pulsed.	1
488	It arrived quickly and was easy to set up ! it was a refurbished amazon echo dot it was above and beyond what I expected ! Alexa and I have become buddies she is a great assistant	1
489	Works as advertised. Speak clearly, and research the commands. Also. Get the wall holder, it keeps it out of the way. Set up is a breeze, just make sure you are close to the device initially when connecting your phone. For some reason it made set up easier...though it could be psychological haha	1
490	Love my two echo dots but the third one we ordered to give as a gift had a defective speaker.  The return process still isn't done and has already taken weeks.	1
491	I've already returned it.	0
492	The refurbished echo for has been wonderful. I purchased this for my mother. She loves the ability to contact me without a phone, listen to music, weather, and ask questions. It's been a wonderful gift and works excellently with no problems	1
493	Works good. However, the price went down the week after I purchased it.	1
494	Works amazingly. I bought it for my daughter and she loves it.	1
495	I love Alexa! It's great helping me, making my appointments, playing the songs I like! What else can you do? Looking forward for more.	1
496	Got this for the bathroom love it we can listen music whe. We showering.	1
497	I have 3-Dots and 2-Original and this new one works perfectly.  Will buy all my future Dots reconditioned.	1
498	Was a little hard to get it to pare up with the others but once it did no problems at all	1
499	Now I'm weary about these picking up conversations when you are not actively using them - heard about this happening on the news.  I have 3-4, so this is very concerning.  I wish Amazon would release something widespread  or push some firmware to prevent this.  If they have, I have not heard about it yet.	0
500	There's really no dislike for Alexa( dot) I thought cortna was cool but Alexa is an awesome application to the family. Unbelievable device which seems alive. A must get.	1
501	I am happy with the refurbished echo dot. I‚Äôve had it for about two weeks, and so far it is working perfectly! Even though it did not come in its original box, it looks like new! I‚Äôm happy with this purchase!	1
502	Thumbs up!	1
503	Workreat	1
504	There was something wrong with the first one that no even the rep I spoke with could fix. The replacement was registered to someone else. When the price of the Dot went down to $39.99 (same price as the refurbished ones), I bought a brand, spanking new one. No problem with the new one.	0
505	Works as expected!	1
506	No problems	1
507	Have these in almost every room. I really have enjoyed them. Works perfectly.	1
508	Purchased for grandson.	1
509	Like new	1
510	Happy with this as I was with the other 2 I ordered!!	1
511	Love the dots, especially with the ability to talk from one to the other, these are really convenient. No issues with the refurbished as they are like new.	1
512	Started taking on her own! Haven‚Äôt used it since I unplugged it that day. No one was talking, my daughter was laying in bed next to be and she just started going on about the movie Moana and completely scared the sh*t out of my daughter now.	1
513	It works great the speaker sounds fine and overall would recommend	1
514	Great! Just like new!	1
515	Loved the price for an essentially brand new Dot!! Opening it, you really couldn‚Äôt tell that it was refurbished. Everything looked brand new. For $20 less than a new unit, I couldn‚Äôt consider this a better deal! I really love the versatility of the echo dot. Get you one while you can!	1
516	Pleased with the order just what I wanted!!	1
517	I think I now have 5 of these throughout the house. So convenient to set a timer or check the weather or whatever, wherever.	1
518	Love it -- the best.  My experience with refurbished devices is excellent.	1
519	Love the echo dot	1
520	This refurbished item was fine,but I wasn't aware that there is a fee for having other echos set up in the rooms.  However, it was missing the cordThank you	1
521	Two weeks after setting it up it no longer works.  No connection, no light, no sound.  I guess I shouldn't have purchased a refurbished Dot.	0
522	It worked like a brandnew unit! Great addition to my collection.	1
523	Great price, works perfectly. Saved the money on a refurb!! Would buy again!	1
524	 	0
525	Very.god	1
526	Not good at all!	0
527	These are great. I bought one and then bought another right away. Grab a few of these and a few smart switched and you're set with smart home capabilities for under $150. Highly recommended.	1
528	Just like new	1
529	Worked as it should, still need to figure out how to link to other devices though, only set up Sonos which was pretty easy. Not the products fault, just have not had time to figure it out.	1
530	Very useful	1
531	This is the worst Amazon purchase I have made. I am big Amazon fan...love the brand...unlimited digital music...prime videos...even buy my online games, music, and movies through Amazon. This app I have tried to use it make simple purchases -- to do anything. It is useless.	0
532	Works very well, but the microphone don&#34;t pick up as well as the full size echo.  Audio quality is okay for the size.	1
533	I bought two refurbished ones for work and home. They both work perfectly and appear brand new	1
534	Amazon doesn't disappoint.	1
535	Works great as a BT receiver with output connected to vintage stereo equipment.	1
536	Working great this far.  Can't tell it's not new.  Will edit for longevity in a year, that's the real test.	1
537	Amazing	1
538	i love everything	1
539	This used ‚Äúdot‚Äù works fine, it compliments my Echo.	1
540	Works like a new one.  Can tell the difference from the new one I bough and the refurbished one.	1
541	Well I‚Äôm a big fan of echoes these ones went I‚Äôm my bathrooms.  Works just great as expected üëçüèæ	1
542	Purchased for my 83 year old mother-she loves talking to Alexa! Very responsive-can detect its ‚Äúname‚Äù from all over the room.	1
543	This is just like new -- same performance as our brand new one; no problems.	1
544	The echo dot disconnects from the speaker about 12-20 times a day. Do not buy the refurbished product.  2 stars for effort.	0
545	Love it.  Great product	1
546	it works good.  very satisfied	1
547	I love Alexa, but the sound on the dot is not the best. I own an echo 2nd gen for the kitchen/living room and got this for my bedroom, but there‚Äôs a SIGNIFICANT difference in sound. The dot lacks a full base sound and sounds as if it‚Äôs coming off a cheap portable speaker. I was REALLY disappointed. I returned it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a second echo 2 for my bedroom also.	1
548	Took me awhile to get it connected. I'm not electronically savy but now that it is, I love it.	1
549	cant seem to get this thing to sink with my wireless not sure If I will be returning it will try one more time.	0
550	Absolutely love it!	1
551	product stopped working after return time ran out	0
552	Second Dot work great for refurbishedThought it was new	1
553	Love these guys they work so great	1
554	I love this as a second &#34;Alexa&#34; in our bedroom.  Great for checking weather, for meditation music, and as a timer - Perfect for my husband who has to use eye drops multiple times each day and keep his eyes closed for 5 minutes.	1
555	I purchased this refurbished.  Works just like brand new.  3 minute set up. Very easy.  Now I have echo dot that I can command to start playing music for my backyard deck sound system.	1
556	Not substitute for the original.  The echo dot performs well but sound quality is poor.  To listen it has to be at the highest level 10.	1
557	Love the Echo Dot. Helps husband get Netflix and other apps on our Amazon Fire TV.  No problems with it being refurbished. Planning on getting another one for the Amazon Fire Stick in bedroom.	1
558	Stopped working after 7 months. The warranty was only good for 3 months. I would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for 3 whole months. I mean what is this product supposed to be, a piece of junk?They offered my a 15% discount if I wanted to buy another one. Why would I want to buy another one?	0
559	Just like new. No problems whatsoever, Alexa. Thank you.	1
560	I like my uncle. But sometime it goes a little Haywire	1
561	Bought this for my son and it didn‚Äôt work. He had to return it.	0
562	Bought 2 and both quit connecting to wifi and responding to voice within 9 months. Hard and soft reset will not fix the problem.	0
563	I received my Echo Dot today in good condition, but be advised: I paid $29.99 for it and Amazon has (as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!Set up with the Dot went simple enough ‚Äî plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iPhone‚Äôs WiFi settings. I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I‚Äôve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I‚Äôm not sure if this is the norm or if it‚Äôs because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don‚Äôt have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic‚Äôs range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple‚Äôs Siri is that when she‚Äôs playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven‚Äôt tried this with louder speakers yet, so I‚Äôm not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations ‚Äî support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can‚Äôt handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would‚Äôve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don‚Äôt want to though ‚Äî Alexa‚Äôs kind of growing on me.	1
564	I bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs. But I have no need for it. I only used it once. The volume was not loud enough for me when I played music while I was on my treadmill. So I rather use my tower speaker which is 3xs louder.	1
565	Worked like new.  Will do it again.	1
566	The second one which was a refurbished model did work-at least not in my home.	0
567	Very bad this device, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself , nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking. When you talk you have to yell super lauded	0
568	Good as new!! Just like brand new! Save yourself some money. Get one!	1
569	Adding more rooms for convenience	1
570	Nice. It works good.Some times is not easy to recognize your voice and you have to repeat several times, some time almost screaming.	1
571	I took a chance on a certified refurbished unit for $29. Looks brand new...no excuses or disappointments. 5 minute trouble-free set up! Effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the Alexa App on my iPhone was flawless. Listening to my favorite tunes through a Bose Bluetooth setup and couldn't be happier. Walk through the door and just ask Alexa to: &#34;Play 80's music&#34; and viola... instant atmosphere! No more opening the iPad, going to settings, turning on bluetooth and then accessing the Pandora app. It just makes things so effortless. A true joy right out of the box! If I didn't discover any other uses for this fine piece of technology it was worth every penny!	1
572	Alexa's sister (my second dot)	1
573	Love my Alexa Echo Dot - I have two of them now - one new, one refurbished.  Both work great and it has become my go to for sooo many things.  I love it as an alarm every morning or whenever.  I love it to play music or sounds of the ocean, or nature sounds when I am trying to sleep.  Just love it for so many things.	1
574	Bought a refurb, and its works just as my new ones I bought prior! Came in original packaging as well!	1
575	Love it. It's like having a second wife.	1
576	So far not impressed at all. Does not save groups correctly can not understand me most of the time I'm not sure what the excitement is all about. Alexas voice sounds like it's under water how am I supposed to understand!!!!I'm going to return and try a google home!!!	0
577	Works well and has no obvious issues from being refurbished.	1
578	Works great, can't tell it was refurbished and set up in kids mode.  I have 3 in my home and will be adding more. I love these things.	1
579	great product, but useless overall. Too many unnecessary features. Unless you have a smart home you don't need it	0
580	Worked just as good as the two new Echo Dots i preciously purchases.	1
581	I bought this for my mother and she is in love with it.She loves the guard dog feature.She says that it gives her a sense of security at night and when she leaves the house	1
582	I bought it mainly to be a speaker when playing music or videos on my phone. Not working for me. Read instructions but not working for me.	1
583	It works	1
584	Bought two of them and both work great. I'm not much on electronics running my home, but Alexa does all that I want and need to be done.	1
585	2nd one... more to come	1
586	Blue light blinks all the time	1
587	Fun and useful. We're still learning new tricks and useful functionalities. This is the future of human to computer interface and household automation. Just like Star Trek! Who knew it would be here so soon?	1
588	Works great to control the TV lights and various other devices. Lately I've been using it when i wake up and don't know what time it is but don't want to open my eyes. Just shout out &#34;Alexa, What time is it?&#34; if i could just figure out how to get it to do house hold chores and walk the dogs it'd be golden! sound is not that great but with its size what can you expect. The Echo Plus has much better audio but that is what you get with the larger more expensive Echo.	1
589	Works great!	1
590	Wasn't sure if I'd like this product but after having it for a little while I want one in every room! My daughter is constantly asking alexa how to spell words. We've barely tapped into all the things this product is capable of and I'm looking forward to learning all of its capabilities!	1
591	A++++	1
592	Great product. Works well	1
593	Absolutly love it !	1
594	Bought my first echo dot and loved it so I got this for work. Absolutely love it!	1
595	works as promised	1
596	Works great with my existing smart home setup.	1
597	Perfect. Could not tell the difference from a new one.	1
598	I cant figure out how to use it.	0
599	Good sometimes can‚Äôt hear well	1
600	I was a little apprehensive about buying a refurbished electronic product, but with Amazon's guarantee, thought I would try it. Glad I did, and will probably buy another refurb product form Amazon. I love the Alexa products and have several. This one sits on my desk. Has a small footprint, but has great sound and I use it daily. Works great.	1
601	Not bad bad speaker for sound	1
602	This is a great device. We mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list, but occasionally use any number of the &#34;fun&#34; things you can program it to do, like go to Red Alert or make the TARDIS land (yes, we're a house of geeks... we even chose the wake-word to be &#34;Computer&#34; instead of &#34;Alexa&#34;. Now we just need Majel Barret's voice and I will be in geek heaven.) ;)It's not as easy to get my Premium Spotify to work properly with it, and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms, but so far it's still been worth it. I am often asking it the time, the weather, it even gives us a news briefing. We also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome. Plus it's fun knowing the NSA is listening to everything.	1
603	We all love her!	1
604	I purchased this for my daughter and we all love this!!!! its amazing!! we love the games!	1
605	It doesn‚Äôt always  work	0
606	Good as new! Perfectly packaged and I have had zero issues with the dot.	1
607	Love it! Bought for my granddaughter who is 3 for her to play music and ask questions. She is entertained for hours! Good buy in my honest opinion!	1
608	No issues...works and looks great!!!	1
609	This is a fun toy.  My daughter have me it.  It reads to me!	1
610	Refurbish Echo Dot received as new condition, as new packaging, no complaints. Neat little gadget.(Drives my wife nuts!)	1
611	I received an Echo as a gift, loved it so much I decided to get the Dot for my bedroom. Both very easy to set up but a big difference in the sound quality. I would still buy it again.	1
612	Worked as advertised. Thanks	1
613	All the new Amazon products I have are great everything I bought refurbished is complete garbage. I will never purchase Amazon refurbished again total dissatisfaction	0
614	Works good.  Microphone is not as good as the better Echo products	1
615	Took a little work to set up but I finally got it.  Sound quality not the best but for what I got it for it works great.  I check weather and ask a few cooking questions in the kitchen with it.  I do play the radio on it when I want some music but will probably upgrade to the Echo plus for better sound.	1
616	Love Alexa these are the best thing I have ever bought don't know how I ever lived with out these things amazing so happy with this product just wish it would use google to	1
617	I loved it it works great	1
618	Extremely low in volume	0
619	I had some trouble getting the program downloaded from my phone. I ended up using my computer. It is interesting that the answers come from Wikipedia. However, I will give Echo dot an &#34;A&#34; in the music playing department. I heard songs and music totally forgotten on the mainstream stations. Also amusing when Alexa responds, I don't know that. Why does she think the yards of cotton fabric refer to football playing???? If I had paid full price for this gadget I would have been sorely disappointed. Now it seems reasonable and a step above HAL.	1
620	Brought to replace one that I moved and doesn't have the same range as my previous (non refurbished) unit. It would seldom be able to find the Wi-Fi and couldn't connect. Got tired of hearing the message (&#34;trouble connecting...check the Alexa app...&#34;) and just unplugged it. I went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times, it's just not as strong.	0
621	If you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the Echo/Dot units simultaneously, YOU MUST PAY A MONTHLY FEE. I thought this was Amazon, not Apple??!! I‚Äôve paid for many of these so I could have one in each room, is that not enough of my money??!!??	0
622	Purchased as a gift,	1
623	Love it	1
624	Overall good device. It was bought for a workout room, and has issues reaching a volume that can be heard over a standard row machine. It could use a much better speaker.	1
625	Works great and simple to set up. Alexa is way more accurate than I imagined so Im using it more than I thought. Wish alarms could be set a bit further out but thats my only complaint.No she's not listening when you don't say the wake word so if you're worried you can lose the conspiracy theories. The speaker is great too so don't hold off on getting one if you were turned off by gen 1 like me.	1
626	The voice clarity has made my eavesdropping efforts so much easier - the government. :)	1
627	Worked perfect	1
628	Had a little trouble at the beginning until I replaced my old router and it works good except for current temperature and at times Alexa will be off by as much as 10 degrees!  Like when it was 91 degrees, Alexa would say it was 81 degrees.  Otherwise, everything works as expected and enjoy listening to music from Amazon and my Pandora stations and requesting my favorite song or recording artist.	1
629	I bought three of these and all three have worked flawlessly. If they weren't labeled as refurbished I wouldn't have known	1
630	This device works perfectly and was a good price.  We love Alexa and are having great fun with her.  The music is great and we get the radio stations we need for our morning traffic report.  I didn‚Äôt think I would enjoy having AI in the house, but it is fun, educational and entertaining even for people who aren‚Äôt tech savvy.	1
631	Eh. It‚Äôs works on and off. Half the time it does not respond when you say wake up name. Other then that works fine	0
632	Great little thing. Works better than siri.	1
633	It‚Äôs amazing I love it	1
634	Bought this for my son and he loves it.	1
635	I own the first and second generation Echo Dot.  I think I prefer the volume ring of the first gen better than the buttons on the second gen, but still more than does the job and great for the price I got it for.  I'd still definitely recommend.	1
636	Very fun to use and having morning briefing	1
637	Arrived on time and works amazing!!!	1
638	Just like new, set-up was quick & easy.	1
639	like new, good refurbishing	1
640	Love it	1
641	Love my echo dot!!!	1
642	I like that it knows my music type.The least is that it isn't wireless and the volume is not that high.	1
643	great product!	1
644	It works great, but the reason I'm leaving 3 stars is because it wont play unless it plugged in the whole time. Pretty irritating especially when there is no outlet available.	1
645	Works great!	1
646	I love it ita like having a personal assistant and computer and everything else in one.	1
647	The problem I have with this item could just be my inexperience. I ordered the wrong thing, but then decided I‚Äôd set it up and use Alexa. I was trying to replace a small Bluetooth speaker in my bedroom. Thought I could learn as I go. I downloaded the app, but never could get the Echo to sync with my iPhone. I‚Äôve decided to give this to one of my kids and they will probably enjoy it and use it as it is intended.	1
648	Es perfecto.	1
649	Working good so far.	1
650	Working great and my daughter loves it!	1
651	Works great	1
652	I love it	1
653	I wanted a white dot for my white bathroom.  The top is black as shown, which I knew, but I did not realize the cord and plug were also black. I wanted a white cord and plug.	0

655	WORKS GREAT	1
656	Amazing!	1
657	Great product	1
658	Works perfectly	1
659	Perfect	1
660	I set up the Echo Dot and it worked for an hour and then died completely. DO NOT BUY refurbished!!!! I sent back for return the day after I received.	0
661	This Echo Dot is horrible. The volume on my phone is louder than than this device. My boss has one at this is not the case	0
662	Overall it works very well. Some connectivity issues but it was definitely worth the money!	1
663	Have had no issues with this refurbished unit. It performed expected. I would buy another one if needed.	1
664	Great for mom its inside an owlhead in her jacuzzi	1
665	Works great - I put this in my son's room and use the drop in option to get his attention when he is gaming or watching tv.	1
666	It was perfect	1
667	It looked brand nrw!! I have nothing to.complain about!! I will defently be ordering more	1
668	It's ok. The speaker is pretty terrible. Google home is a better product.	0
669	I love it!	1
670	I love this, answers all my stupid questions and tells me the weather for when I don‚Äôt get off the couch	1
671	The first one quit working shortly after I got it. The next one becomes unresponsive to my voice at times and the only way to get it to work is through the app. I am not sure if it just this Dot or they are all this way.	0
672	Bought this to go in my niece's room. You can't tell it's refurbished. It looks good and works like new.	1
673	Device was not working. Followed all instructions for Alexa echo dot and it did not come on. Very upsetting.	0
674	Sent it back due to crackling noise and turning itself off and on - but what can you expect with a refurbished item?	0
675	Best price we could find and it is so useful to have her around to answer questions. It is so handy to not have to find your phone. I also now have an intercom system.	1
676	I have never been more satisfied with a product. Perfect introduction to Alexa.	1
677	Works well, but the speaker is not so grand. Getting another speaker to drop this into. In the future I would have just gone with the full size echo.	1
678	Love our echo! Thing the full size version sounds better though.	1
679	Works great!	1
680	It has all I need for my life plans time date music	1
681	Seems to have trouble hearing me when I say the wake word despite being trained to my voice... Wonder if this has something to do with buying it refurbished. Our google home mini has no problems hearing us üò¨ and is much louder.	1
682	Love it!  Works perfectly!	1
683	I had a brand new echo Dot and thought that the refurbished would be just as good. It was quite different from my expectations. Refurbished unit did not even turn on and after a while I realized that the power adapter was faulty. There is no way for me to have Amazon send me a power adapter by itself according to the return options. I love Amazon and buy even my toilet paper through them but this was truly a let down.Update: Amazon contacted me and credited me enough to buy a new power adapter. This is why I shop on Amazon. I can always trust them to deliver on their products.	1
684	I bought this for a family member as a gift. I called her to see how she likes it & she said she loves it‚ÄºÔ∏è	1
685	Not very loud but quality and ease of use is great. Sound is perfect for background music, would suggest 2-or more connected together if you‚Äôre trying to use for hosting a louder party	1
686	Looked Brand new works great. I love these echo dots and the refurbished ones are like new	1
687	My 2nd one and I use them all the time.	1
688	Is working like a  new one for now, l have another 3 alexa devices lm a fanatic	1
689	Echo is good.	1
690	Works great	1
691	Great price to extend the range and super value to dot offers. Hooked up wireless speaker to use working outside.This dot made outdoor sound range possible without disturbing indoor light control possible	1
692	Amazingly fun. My daughter and I just asked questions on the first day. I have now set my daily alarm, weekend reminder, playlist, morning shows, random songs, daily bible verses, weather, and morning commute. It tells me which way to go dodging traffic. You have to get one. I don‚Äôt have it linked to my phone yet.	1
693	Works perfect! There‚Äôs no difference at all between this refurb one and my new ones that I have in my house. I‚Äôll be buying the refurbs from here on out	1
694	Great product. Wakes me up every morning on time!	1
695	Like new.  No difference from new unused original.	1
696	I have no complaints. As far as I know, these are exactly like new, just a little cheaper. Great!	1
697	Perfect condition!	1
698	Like new	1
699	It works just as well as the new version I got as a discount with my Echo speaker. I decided to purchase this version because Amazon states it has the same warranty.	1
700	I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can‚Äôt wait to see what else it can do.	1
701	Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet.	1
702	I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.	1
703	looks great	1
704	Love it! I‚Äôve listened to songs I haven‚Äôt heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It‚Äôs great!	1
705	I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly.	1
706	I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times	1
707	I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!	1
708	Love, Love, Love!!	1
709	Just what I expected....	1
710	I love it, wife hates it.	1
711	Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.	1
712	We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.	1
713	We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound	1
714	I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)	1
715	Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.	1
716	We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying.	1
717	Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it‚Äôs not intrusive to look at.	1
718	I love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask	1
719	I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation.	1
720	Amazing product	1
721	I love my Echo. It's easy to operate, loads of fun.It is everything as advertised. I use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test Alexa's knowledge.	1
722	Sounds great!! Love them!	1
723	Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better.	1
724	Just like the other one	1
725	Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good	1
726	I like it	1
727	She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa ‚Äúlearn‚Äù Tasha‚Äôs birthday.  Or Alexa ‚Äúlearn‚Äù my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great	1
728	The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.	1
729	This device is awesome!	1
730	I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.	1
731	Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn‚Äôt able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube.	1
732	Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo	1
733	This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is.	1
734	This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!	1
735	My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities	1
736	My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running.	1
737	So far so good	1
738	Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.	1
739	Great	1
740	Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.	1
741	It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals.	0
742	Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.	1
743	I love you so much	1
744	No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify ‚Äúplus/prime/etc‚Äù account.  So you must pay to play ‚Äúyour‚Äù music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is üëçüèª .	1
745	Excelente, lo unico es que no esta en espa√±ol.	1
746	I'm still learning how to use it, but so far my Echo is great! The sound is actually much better than I was expecting.	1
747	Works as you‚Äôd expect and then some. Also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.	1
748	The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.	1
749	like google better	1
750	Just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it.	1
751	Works as advertised. Very easy to setup. Still learning what this can do.	1
752	Great sound and easy to set up.	1
753	Love Alexa, bought others for friends	1
754	Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs	1
755	üòç	1
756	Love being able to listen to music easily. Still learning all the features available	1
757	Did t really know what I could use this device for. Used it for a few things, but need an overview	1
758	Love this just wish it had a built in hub	1
759	I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!	1
760	How easy if was to set up.	1
761	Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.	1
762	You‚Äôre all I need...na na nana!	1
763	Does everything as expected and more.	1
764	I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so I cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good.	1
765	Great sound in a small package‚Äîeasy to set up and use; fun to own.	1
766	Works and sounds great.	1
767	The sound is amazing and many collections of all music	1
768	Setting up	1
769	She doesn‚Äôt always listen	1
770	It‚Äôs awesome	1
771	I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I‚Äôm hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many ‚Äúapps‚Äù you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I‚Äôm looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located.	1
772	The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!	1
773	I LIKE IT ALL	1
774	I love it. It does everything	1
775	I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I'm not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! I'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!	1
776	I like it and still learning how to use it.	1
777	Great technology!! Can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!	1
778	I purchased an echo dot for my husband for Fathers Day.  He uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the Echo (2nd Generation), It was a no-brainer.  Best gift ever!	1
779	Works fine!!	1
780	 	1
781	Clear music	1
782	Fun to use, good sound quality	1
783	The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.	1
784	Works great, but I don't think Amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1) Have Prime AND 2) Buy an Echo.	1
785	Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!	1
786	The speaker sounds really good	1
787	Good sound works well	1
788	Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.	1
789	Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.	1
790	We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet.	1
791	Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!	1
792	Love the Echo !!! I love the size, material and speaker quality. I have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat. Next is Echo Dot for bedroom. There is a lot more to do with Echo that you think. Traffic, Weather, Trivia, etc.	1
793	Love it!	1
794	The entire family loves Alexa Echo. She‚Äôs now a part of this family.	1
795	Great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  WOW -- family fun and homework help.  Talking with other grandchildren,who also have an Echo, is a HUGE bonus.  Can't wait to learn more and more and more	1
796	Love it!	1
797	awesome thing, love Alexa	1
798	It worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound. It is perfect for my classroom!	1
799	LOVE, LOVE this new little gadget.  Has  made our lives so much easier.  it's like having our own personal secretary living here in the home.  We hardly need our CD's anymore, since ALEXA plays everything we need.  Going to get the Alexa DOTS soon for more rooms.  Thanks!!	1
800	The speaker is of surprising quality. Happy with the purchase.	1
801	Very easy to set up. Works wonderful and I love it!!	1
802	I'm really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it's coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.	1
803	It‚Äôs still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don‚Äôt get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it‚Äôs great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it‚Äôs even better.	1
804	The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.	1
805	Great device, responsive and helpful	1
806	Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose	0
807	i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that.	1
808	Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.	1
809	Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.	1
810	4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product.	1
811	Works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn‚Äôt be happier!	1
812	It's Alexa.... what else can you say	1
813	Upgraded from my lilttle echo dot. Happy with sound	1
814	Excellent product, set up with ease as well.	1
815	I've had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I'm happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.	1
816	I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.	1
817	wonderful product and fast delivery!	1
818	Initially harder to set up called tech wasn‚Äôt that knowledgeable now working great.	1
819	It was very easy to set up and my family love it‚Äôs!	1
820	Has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.	1
821	How did I live this long without the Echo . You get to enjoy any music style  just my asking Alexa . Going to up-greade to the wireless . Love the Echo . Love you too Alexa .	1
822	Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.	1
823	Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I‚Äôm across the room or busy doing something else.	1
824	So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well.	1
825	Love our echo	1
826	I love it,she is very helpful. I use her for remembering things and sleep. You can ask her just about anything. I have only had her for about a week so still learning her.	1
827	It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it.	1
828	I love having an Alexa!	1
829	So far I like it ü§ì	1
830	I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.	1
831	Still love it	1
832	Love it	1
833	I love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound.	1
834	I just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.	1
835	I have had for only a week, so I am still learning all that Alexa can do.  It is a learning process.  I love the music I can call up any time.  I listen to podcasts and radio stations.  I have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which I love.  I don‚Äôt have to search for paper and pencil.  Getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  The sound is good.  I am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the Echo is fine for me.  This afternoon I am going to try ‚Äúdropping in‚Äù.on my son when he gets home.  Going to surprise him.	1
836	Not much features.	0
837	Great sound quality, great features, great product. Multi room music is very cool.	1
838	Cool	1
839	Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.	1
840	it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself	1
841	I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn't be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.	1
842	I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if I am not very specific about the title.	1
843	I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.	1
844	The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.	1
845	Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music.	1
846	Love it	1
847	awesome.understands my kids	1
848	We were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. How nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. Looking forward to exploring other options with this device.	1
849	Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.	1
850	I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT, I really love having the music.	1
851	i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries.	1
852	This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!	1
853	"During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my ""smart"" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!"	1
854	Versatile and fun !!!	1
855	Works great! Killer speaker! My wife and son love it.	1
856	We regret waiting so long to purchase this item. We are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.	1
857	Stopped working after 2 weeks ,didn't follow commands!? Really fun when it was working?	0
858	so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app	1
859	It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.  Do you have a chart showing the language I need to use?	1
860	Easy to set up.	1
861	I like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality I expected	1
862	A great investment. Alexa has helped me out and made me laugh.	1
863	Yet another Exho for our home and love them all!!!	1
864	I love it, I can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz, not easy to find on local radio. Sound is good and I can stop it with a voice command if I get a phone call.	1
865	Good Value	1
866	Super easy set up and am loving our new Echo!	1
867	Whats not to like about this speaker.  Just ask Alexa	1
868	BEST father's day gift. Dad joked to my mom that Alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.	1
869	Great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  Tunes and information instantly available.  Slowly learning more features.	1
870	Sound quality	1
871	Sad joke. Worthless.	0
872	Entertainment	1
873	Very good quality	1
874	Works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability	1
875	Loved it till someone stoled it. Can't afford to replace it yet but I am going too.	1
876	Alexa rocks	1
877	Got this as a gift and love it. I never would have bought one for myself, but now that I have it.... Allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music ; that's worth it in and of itself.  Also, gives new's briefs and tells jokes.	1

879	My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her ‚Äúno‚Äù for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It‚Äôs that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you‚Äôre going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou‚Äôll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn‚Äôt live without.	1
880	Love it!! Great product!!!	1
881	Easy set up very user friendly	1
882	Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa.	0
883	I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.	1
884	Everything	1
885	I like the interaction of asking questions. I don‚Äôt like that I can‚Äôt ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.	1
886	Supberb sound! Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.	1
887	I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!	1
888	Love it!  So do the grandkids!!	1
889	"So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or ""skills"", but getting the hang of it."	1
890	Works as advertised	1
891	I love it!	1
892	Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won‚Äôt respond or says she doesn‚Äôt recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won‚Äôt respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it‚Äôs a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too.	1
893	Like everything about it. The music, the trivia games, the weather.	1
894	As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.	1
895	A great device	1
896	I owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since English is her second language she was born in korea. But the sound from the echo is superb. So we‚Äôll keep it..	1
897	Love this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!	1
898	Very nice!  I'm impressed - wish she had more to say though.	1
899	Love the product. Nice to have easy access to so much info!!!	1
900	It's got great sound and bass but it doesn't work all of the time. Its still hot or miss when it recognizes things	0
901	We are still discovering all that the Echo can do.	1
902	Amazing paroduct	1
903	Good hearing range and sound quality. It was a bit complicated to set up and she doesn't quite understand me a lot even when I am speaking slowly and clearly but I love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system.	1
904	speaker sounds good	1
905	Absolutely love!!	1
906	The best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  There isn‚Äôt anything I dislike.	1
907	We're thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We're enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We've added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.	1
908	Home entertainment	1
909	Very cool product. Easy to setup, fun to use and sound quality is much better than I anticipated.	1
910	Love these,  great sound... easy to connect and use...	1
911	Doesn't work with my fairly new smart TV, but that's mainly the TV manufacturers(LG) fault due to not supporting anything older than TVs from this year. My smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well. Speakers sound great and works very well.	1
912	Great sound from a little speaker	1
913	We enjoy it	1
914	 	1
915	Cool	1
916	Good quality, great sound quality	1
917	Works perfectly	1
918	Great product. Sometimes Alexa does not understand some commands for my Fire TV. All in all, this is a fabulous speaker.	1
919	Love my Echo great sound very smart!	1
920	Sure did !! Love it !!	1
921	plays great	1
922	Works absolutely great	1
923	Very amazing product. Great sound quality.	1
924	Best thing I've invested in in a while thank you so much üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ	1
925	I am extremely impressed with this item. Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can't tell it even has one. works great. Didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It's not a BOSE but it's more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can't wait to get for my classroom too! It's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it.	1
926	I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!	1
927	Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!	1
928	I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. She isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again.	0
929	I like everything about it !!!	1
930	Liked 100%	1
931	Never had ANY issue with buying use electronics as long as I get the GOOD or LIKE NEW. Just read the comment to see why it is used.	1
932	Our family really loves this new Echo	1
933	bought for my wife she loves it	1
934	Fun just got it today now my I pod will go in my car and I will use this is the house.	1
935	Like it to do more	1
936	This is our third echo. Worth every penny. It's like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc.	1
937	Listen music and set timer	1
938	I received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!	1
939	Good sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!	1
940	Purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.	1
941	This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller.	1
942	Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!	1
943	I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don't consider it an upgrade.	1
944	I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them	1
945	I‚Äôm having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I‚Äôm not exactly tech smart. I‚Äôm sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I‚Äôve been using it mostly for music.	1
946	Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I'm too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.	1
947	Enjoyed entire echo experience	1
948	Easy to set up.	1
949	The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.	1
950	We are loving Ours very much	1
951	I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you	1
952	Very pleased with the Echo 2nd Generation. It is so nice to have Alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven‚Äôt discovered.	1
953	"I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a ""smart home"". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!"	1
954	Easy to setup. Love all the things she does.	1
955	Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!	1
956	I already have an Alexa and with Amazon find today I could not resist getting an echo also. It is the best thing I ever did, I use them on each side of the house! And couldn't be happier!	1
957	Arrived as expected.	1
958	Bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! Don't forget to buy a charger when ordering, it's a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard.	1
959	Terrific	1
960	Love my Echo	1
961	It‚Äôs smaller than the original. Looks nicer too.	1
962	Works great!	1
963	My husband and I are what I would call &#34;late adopters&#34; when it come to technology, but we decide we would try and Echo to serve primarily as a music source.  Wow, were we amazed and the great sound!  We've also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking Alexa.  I may even buy one for my elderly Dad - I think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us!	1
964	I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels, plays iHeartRadio and Pandora , adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights.	1
965	I have been wanting one of these for a while now.  Bought on Prime Day and absolutely love it.	1
966	We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.	1
967	See subject line.  Love it	1
968	Love it!	1
969	Very easy setup.	1
970	I was hesitant to buy the echo because I have the echo Dot and it seems good enough. The echo is the same except the sound quality, which I really didn't feel I needed. However, I am so glad I got it. What a difference! The sound really is far superior to the Echo Dot! Now I can listen to The Greatest Showman with a little more power!	1
971	Sound quality is great. Still learning about all the different things I can do with it. FUN!!!	1
972	Got a good deal and works great with Prime.  Setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service.  Has worked great with nice sound from small speaker.	1
973	I love it!!	1
974	Works great! Perfect for my office!	1
975	Love it--- have one inside house and one by our pool now . Just as good as Bose speakers around house -	1
976	easy to use--amazing	1
977	Nice product A+	1
978	We love our Echo! We were totally amazed at the speaker quality. Only bummed we didn‚Äôt buy two since we got it on Prime day!	1
979	Very responsive. Great sound quality for its size.	1
980	It's so efficient and amazing!  How COOL!  We all use it often every day...	1
981	I‚Äôm impressed with the quality of sound that the Echo has, it‚Äôs definitely comparable to my Bose Mini. I only gave 4 stars because I can‚Äôt use my Apple Music account.	1
982	Technology in such a small device. The price was good too! The sound is amazing! A must have feature for any home!	1
983	Mainly use it for the music but I‚Äôm learning more all the time.  Really nothing bad to say about it	1
984	I replaced my 1st gen, was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same sound...I was wrong.  If anything it's the same volume, and more clear.  Good product.	1
985	Great addition to my Echo Plus!	1
986	the best	1
987	Love the feature to play music in every room with multiple Echos.	1
988	I love Alexa!  I am surprised how much I use her.	1
989	I use this product for enjoyment and I just love it	1
990	Easy to use and has great sound...It was a great purchase at a great price.	1
991	Very easy to set up and have no issues.	1
992	This unit add much pleasure to our Echo Plus.  We now can have music and information through our home. (or just in one room)	1
993	It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.	1
994	Too difficult to set up.  It keeps timing out before you can enter the password	0
995	Just getting use to using the Echo. Used it for shopping lists, listening to music and as a timer. Working great so far.	1
996	Very cool and lots of fun! Used for a week and still learning its capabilities.	1
997	Love it, love it!!!!!!!!	1
998	Love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps	1
999	I use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information	1
1000	it's great for music, a little hard to figure out how it works.	1
1001	This was given to my 7 year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad. He loves it, ask Alexa anything she has the answer, plus it‚Äôs good for homework. So I purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when I‚Äôm getting ready for work. I listen to music at 4am and the base it‚Äôs metro booming.. Replacement for my clock radio, plus I have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock..	1
1002	Very impressed with look, clarity of sound and color.	1
1003	Alexa is amazing! Great speaker.	1
1004	Still getting used to Alexa, don't have her connected to our TV yet or other things right now use her for music and information, which she is great!!	1
1005	Works and sounds great! My house is barely 1100sf, and I have this sitting on my kitchen counter. I can hear it, and speak to it from any room. Lots of functionality still to discover.	1
1006	I have had pure fun with my echo.  Weather, jokes, news briefing, and music but still so much more to use it for.  A lot of fun for the money.	1
1007	Use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home	1
1008	Love it, still learning, makes a lot of things easier, like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask Alexa to turn the light off.	1
1009	Bought this for my daughter when she turned 9.  She loves it!!  I especially like the calling feature since she doesn‚Äôt have a cell phone.  She loves playing music and dancing and with Amazon music she can play all her favorite songs ...... sometimes over and over and over again lol!	1
1010	We got this as a wedding gift and haven‚Äôt discovered all of its features yet. Will update. Playing music is great though!	1
1011	I am impressed with the sound quality.	1
1012	Very pleased with my purchase of Echo Smart Speaker - love the fact that I can play music of different genre's whenever I want.Had some trouble at first with the WI FI, but it is now working.	1
1013	My  wife & I enjoy the ease of playing our music. The games are fun & entertaining, I look forward to adding more smart products to my home.	1
1014	This is my second Echo and I love how it helps me in the kitchen. I can set timers, listen to the news, prepare grocery lists, and get great music.	1
1015	The sound quality is good just wish alexa could answer more questions	1
1016	This is my second Echo, I have the Dot but the speaker is weak so I purchased this and for listening to music the speaker is great.	1
1017	great sound	1
1018	Great	1
1019	We really only use this as a speaker to stream music. We‚Äôve had it 7 months and it‚Äôs just kinda useless.	1
1020	Once set up very user friendly. Set-up wasn't as user friendly as I'd hoped.. The alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers. My wife and I are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install Alexa, but if my son wasn't supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using Alexa yet.	1
1021	Very easy set up. Really enjoying it	1
1022	The echo doesn‚Äôt come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it, makes it quite inconvenient.	1
1023	more compact and a bit better than the original	1
1024	I love it pretty cool.	1
1025	I having it in my living room. Music sounds really good in my living room . I can hear it upstairs.	1
1026	This is a great product!  Set up was easy.  Sound is wonderful.	1
1027	So far I like it.  I bought it just for some music though, and it sounds pretty good.	1
1028	Love it	1
1029	Love it.	1
1030	Glad I bought this.	1
1031	Like, all types of fun,music, and more	1
1032	I like the volume up and down on the top so I can turn it down quickly.	1
1033	Beyond my capabilities to program. Grandkids lve it	1
1034	I love my new echo.  It gives me hours of music and help with other things.It was difficult for me to set it up,  I had to have help from a Tekkie	1
1035	Almost as good as my Bose. Love the whole house music.	1
1036	Alexa hardly came on..	0
1037	Easy setup using the app, which was also easy to install on my phone.  The sound quality while for listening to music on Pandora is wonderful!!	1
1038	I‚Äôm still learning how to use the Echo, but so far I love it!	1
1039	Works awesome!	1
1040	Works great.	1
1041	From such a small speaker it sounds great	1
1042	Great sound for the size and the prize!! And of course....Alexa!	1
1043	if you don't have an Echo you definitely need one	1
1044	Great device.  Seems to work better than the 1st generation!	1
1045	Very useful	1
1046	Great Prime Day Buy!	1
1047	I love Alexa!	1
1048	Alexa is easy to operate and set up.  Have had it for about 10 days now and love it.	1
1049	Great speaker with a lot of capabilities. Very fun to learn how to use it.	1
1050	I used the product for my phone to look up the weather and watch videos	1
1051	Don‚Äôt use it for much as I thought we would. Synced with Kasa-Cam and use it to check up on our baby in the crib a lot. Lyrics for music is cool, too. Other than that it‚Äôs used as a clock and standard dot‚Äôish features.	1
1052	Amazing so far. Just got it the other day.	1
1053	I like that it's smaller, but it has never understood commands as easily as our first-gen original Echo did.	1
1054	Worthy successor to the echo dot and right at home in the bed room as an alarm clock.  However, for the price it should come with the stand	1
1055	I love this device! All the functionality of an Amazon Echo with the added benefit of a video screen. It looks great on my nightstand as a clock (lots of faces to choose from) and displays weather, reminders, etc. I think it can do video calls too but I use FaceTime for that anyway. It‚Äôs a great shape and doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of room. I‚Äôm planning to get another one for my guest room. Awesome for a great price!	1
1056	I love the Echo Spot. This bedside alarm clock size device can do what theEcho Show can do. I was concerned because I already had a large Echo in mybedroom that answered to ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù like the other devices in my home. I wasconcerned about having both devices answering at the same time when I discoveredthat I had other name choices (not enough for me but just enough to avoid confusion).I named him ‚ÄúEcho.‚Äù Now if I could only choose a male voice. I loved that I could link it tomy security camera and my new doorbell. So many more features. Don‚Äôt forget to buy thestand/base. So many advantages to having that. Read the reviews. Highly recommend.	1
1057	I love this little Spot more than I thought I would. The sound is great for such a little thing...my music plays nice and loud and clear. The video is terrific...I was watching some Prime shows just for the heck of it, and I was really impressed. Immediately convinced my mom to buy my sister one for her birthday!Only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars...I really wish it was cordless. I love having it in my kitchen but trying to find a place to plug it in is a pain. And it won‚Äôt connect to my Bluetooth speaker while playing Amazon Prime Music for some reason, which is a drag when I want to hear it in the dining room during dinner. Of course, if it was CORDLESS I could just bring it with me...otherwise, I absolutely love it and will probably buy another one!	1
1058	I bought on Prime Day and so glad I did. It‚Äôs easy to use and lots of customization options. I know some reviews said that the screen was small and hard to read, but I disagree.	1
1059	Honestly I like it but at the same time I don‚Äôt I could have bought a smaller one that did the exact same thing for less then half I bought it for the video chat and I have never really used it	0
1060	Overall it's great and I like that I can see lyrics and the time and  date. However, sometimes it freezes and doesn't respond properly--no error message about lack of connectivity--it just stops. Resetting resolves the problem.	1
1061	I love all that you can do with the Echo Spot!	1
1062	The thing I like most about my Echo Spot is the voice command feature.  You can ask anything and get an answer or play any music without getting up to adjust the Echo. Easy to use	1
1063	Love it!! Perfect for an alarm clock replacement, plus so much more!!	1
1064	I love the Echo Spot as it is great for checking the weather along with many other things, but most important it works great as your alarm clock in your bedroom!	1
1065	We absolutely love this product!!! Wish we would have bought this instead of the dots!!!	1
1066	We like that we are able to get weather and other information quickly.  You can even hear music played. The speaker is clear.  We are enjoying it.  What we did not like because it was creepy was that the day before my husband played a particular song on our stereo for me.  The next day, I asked the Echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song.  The Echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before.  It was a little disconcerting.	1
1067	I like echo spot. I bought it to use as an alarm clock. One negative that i didnt really think about, when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy, its hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm, or hard to remember commands to snooze for a few minutes. In this case a clock with buttons seems to work better	1
1068	This is our second Echo Spot - to go with out two Echo Dots - love the look and how Alexia responds.	1
1069	Love my Echo Spot!	1
1070	It is very slow compared to the echo	0
1071	I love the way it is designed. And you have choices for the face.  I use it for my bed side.  I drop in; on my echo in another part of the house frequently without yelling.	1
1072	Terrific sound for a small device, and nice form factor for the nightstand. I like the convenience of seeing the time and temperature rather than asking Alexa. Not using video much, but it would be nice if the device had a square/rectangular screen.	1
1073	New to Alexa. Like this spot a lot.	1
1074	It's not perfect, but I really like this little gizmo. i bought it primarily for 2 purposes. First, so I could set wake-up alarms by individual days, and set the wake-up music individually by the day. Second, I wanted to control a bedroom light by voice, so I could shut it off as I was falling asleep, without having to get out of bed to turn a switch. The Echo Spot, together with a smart plug,has been able to accomplish that. A bonus has been getting Alexa to play music from my Amazon Prime playlists.What's not so great is that sometimes Alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions, and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating. Hopefully the AI gets better in the future, along with added functions.	1
1075	I love it.  It is so easy to use	1
1076	Put this on my night stand to use as a clock and alarm. Works great. Every morning I get the weather and news when I get up. Also reminds me of all the appointments my wife and I have.	1
1077	Love it	1
1078	Part of it is my fault, I thought it could be wireless.  Though for the price, I still feel like it should be. Also the sound quality and volume could be better. I prefer the tap. Unless you really want to have the call options but today most of us have phones, computers or iPads. Just not worth it.	1
1079	Very easy to use and much quicker then looking up everything on the cell phone.	1
1080	I love my new Echo Spot!	1
1081	I love this clock, I just have to tell it to set my alarm.  No more fussing with buttons!	1
1082	Couldn't be more pleased. Amazon hit this one out of the park. Looks great and runs great. Love it!	1
1083	Responds easily and like the ability to do at night.	1
1084	Easy setup  Love it!	1
1085	Simply amazing what a awsome device. It never ceases to amaze me, wake up to big bang music, go to sleep softly falling rain. Drop in on the kids and keep in touch. I have just scratched the surface as to what this devise can do.	1
1086	I was skeptical at first but &#34;it&#34; grows on you.  It looks good, so far.  I did, however, turn off the camera.	1
1087	Sound quality is disappointing.	1
1088	I love it!  I especially love that it is so small and does so much.  Got rid of my old CD/Alarm clock radio.  Much more room on nightstand.	1
1089	Great sound and video plus all the great stuff that Alexa has to offer even turns my lights on and off	1
1090	The ease to use product	1
1091	So far pretty happy with the Spot. For me it really is a glorified alarm clock/radio and I know I could have something more cost effective but eh, I like it. I had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did. So far so good.	1
1092	I am just entering the &#34;smart&#34; technology world. I haven't figured it all out yet, but so far it's pretty cool!	1
1093	It was smaller than I had anticipated, and when I say that I very much mean it. However, it still works very well! Quality sound, easily programmed, easy to work with, but Alexa is not anywhere as good as other voice programs.	1

1095	Love my Echo Spot!	1
1096	Great deal, great product!	1
1097	Perfect	1
1098	i had a couple of echo dots previously - bought these _SPECIFICALLY_ for the Ring doorbell video / cloud cam display / interface capabilities. WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. Love the fact that I can ask to see front yard / back yard / front door, etc.the video chat with the other rooms is also quite cool.BONUS: ‚ÄúAlexa show me Ant Man trailer, etc‚Äùi know this can all be done on laptop/desktop, but it‚Äôs cool now having an ‚Äòappliance‚Äô that‚Äôs always just there, and it doesn‚Äôt interrupt what i‚Äôm doing.	1
1099	Bought this for my bedroom and the Show for my living room. Love them both. The Spot is perfect for bedside and has an impressive design. Shows lyrics, photos , etc. I paired it with a Smart Plug for the bedroom lamps &#34;Alexa, turn off lights&#34;, love it.	1
1100	Love that is can do so much! It sits on my nightstand! Only improvements I would make is having battery back up capability and the screen could be a tad bigger. But overall I‚Äôm happy I have it! Would recommend!	1
1101	It was a gift and the recipient love love loves it üòçüíãüíãüíãüíã‚ù§!	1
1102	Cool little piece of tech...we‚Äôre still learning some of its functions and possibilities, but I can see some potential.  Even my ‚Äòtechnically challenged‚Äô wife already figured out how to video call our daughter.	1
1103	I have been extremely impressed with the device as a whole. Completely changed sleep schedule and replaced my alarm clock. It is the perfect bedside counter device - alarm, wake up music, weather, top news stories, etc. Perfect device for what I wanted and does so much more than I expected it to do, calling feature is also a huge selling point. This is a must own item. Probably will grab more Echos in the future.	1
1104	As an Alexa device, it works just as well as any of the other products.  Unfortunately it doesn't go up from there.  The ability to play videos is very limited.  You CAN NOT play YouTube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange. There is quite a selection of clock faces, and you can control what is displays with one glaring and VERY ANNOYING exception.  You can't turn off the &#34;Things to try&#34; screen You can turn off the screen scroll, but that defeats the purpose of having the screen.  I don't need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things I can do with Alexa.  I don't need the advertising, especially at the cost of this device.  Overall, its an expensive Alexa device with a screen that's not very useful and annoying.  I would not recommend this until the Amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that's actually useful.	0
1105	So far so good.	1
1106	This device is perfect for a smart nightstand clock. I love how it dims based on the ambient light in the room. Its the first nightstand clock I have had in my bedroom in years because the lighting and glow from typical alarm clocks bother me when trying to sleep. The screen on this dims when the lights in the room go out and is not bothersome at all.Overall a great addition to my smart home. Its nice to be able to tell Alexa to turn on/off the bedroom lights without even getting out of bed or reaching for your phone. I have a bunch of other Alexa devices, but this was the first one with a screen.	1
1107	I love this thing. I talk to it through walls and in other rooms. I have been an amazon lover for a while so I have amazon music unlimited, kindle unlimited, prime video, etc., so I was ready for this when it came out. The screen is just so nice to have.The only thing resembling a down side is that it doesn't always perfectly understand which song I want to hear, but I do have a deep southern accent, lower Alabama, so I don't speak English anyways.	1
1108	Smaller than I thought it would be. Happy I got a stand so it sits up higher on the bedside table.	1
1109	Echo Spot works well except it does not work with the Ring doorbell as it states on the website. Since they were sold as a pair I thought that it would be app ready.  Unfortunately that is not case.  Perhaps Ring will update so that they can be integrated.	1
1110	Nice	1
1111	I like it	1

1113	We've owned a number of Echo devices, but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool.  Other than playing music through a sound system, we haven't found much use for them.  We just don't find the voice user interface to be all that efficient.  The Echo Spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that you're routinely interested in.  Furthermore, you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings.  We now use these as bedside clocks.	1
1114	I love my Echo Spot.  Waking to my favorite music.  Being able to completely turn off display at night so my bedroom is dark.  All the skills I have yet to try.  Easy to use.	1
1115	I like how small it is, but I‚Äôm still able to see my Ring cameras.	1
1116	Great for checking in on my son after school when I'm still at work.  Love getting the weather and traffic in the morning so I can plan my route accordingly	1
1117	Love it!! Super fun! Easy to use! My three year old even gets involved	1
1118	I returnef this item because it does not speak Spanish	0
1119	 	0
1120	I am a hardcore fan of Echo. Infact I am in love with all members of my Alexa family. I have Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus and now this new toddler Echo Spot. Every variant has its own beauty. I love feel and size of Echo Spot. It‚Äôs fabulous as far as looks are concerned. It does not have great Audio quality (which I did not expect at the time of placing order because of its compact and small size). I bought it to connect with my Bose SoundTouch.	1
1121	Love this!	1
1122	I love being able to have Alexa sing careless whisper into my ear to wake me up.	1
1123	Works great as a bedside clock but the microphone for Alexa doesn't work as well as the normal Echo.  Sometimes Alexa doesn't hear me when I try to interrupt her it to give new instructions.  The speaker also isn't as good as the normal Echo.  Screen is small so not really useful for viewing any type of video or for seeing who's at the front door.  But, it's great for the bedside.	1
1124	Fun tech toy	1
1125	Love it. Small with good sound	1
1126	With the combination of this, smart plugins, and the Alex app I can turn stuff on and off with my phone or telling Alexa to do it. I can order stuff, get answers, watch videos, get weather, set alarms, video call, and so much more with this device!	1
1127	Great product	1
1128	In a matter of minutes it became indispensable addition to our house. Extrimelly useful hub of information, music, automation, communication, and assistant in basic needs. Would love to have a voice personalization. Some things are better not to said aloud but typed (like door unlocking codes) but that is problem of unwitty developers. So far only positive experience. The privacy invasions is happened way before Alexa, it is on your phone no matter brand or carrier. To Alexa defence at list it has a button to turn a microphone off.	1
1129	I love this device! It's so great. What a great alarm clock and what a surprisingly good speaker! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because it needs to have a few more features like playing YouTube videos, and Google play music. The camera is not very good in low light if you decide to drop in and it's dark in the room.Other than those minor things, I love it. Great buy and would buy again	1
1130	Hands free control	1
1131	Great love the display and easy to use, though still learning what all it can do everyday.	1
1132	It has been able to interpret my instructions pretty well right from the start, even from a distance. A lot of the skills are excellent. I've added a few of the late shows to my flash briefing but it's ridiculous that it can't access YouTube.It might be important to note that adding an event to your calendar is a task; it seems to have difficulty with the time span of an event. I imagine this is a functionality people would use often.	1
1133	Setup was easy and it is a fantastic alarm clock	1
1134	Great product! Highly recommend getting the stand that goes under it, it sits much better on the desk.	1
1135	Eh it‚Äôs cool and all but also kinda boring I don‚Äôt really know what to do with it other than it being a desk clock so 3/5 is about right. I can‚Äôt connect to my Spotify unless it‚Äôs premium and I‚Äôm in college and I‚Äôm not paying or that or amazon music so	1
1136	I am huge Amazon fan! First to have a kindle and the echo. I waited a bit on this but have wanted it for awhile. I do love it!! My kids love it! They love watching videos and the lyrics to the songs. Now the video calling feature is nothing like how the advertisement made it out. I thought as long as someone would FaceTime me I could do it through that and I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs Spot to Spot. Can‚Äôt even Skype (which I do often with my aunt). The is my major disappointment with it.	1
1137	LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE. The only think I notice is that it doesn't pick-up my voice and commands as well as my Echo and Echo Dots (we have 4 Echo products throughout our house). I have this in the kitchen and in my bedroom as my alarm clock. I'm no longer searching for a pen and paper to make lists!!!!	1
1138	Love my Amazon products	1
1139	Love this	1
1140	Love my spot. Have that , a dot, and a regular echo	1
1141	Nice upgrade from an Echo Dot.	1
1142	Works decent, wish it was able to answer more questions....need a better source for info but the rest works great!	1
1143	I can't live without Alexa.	1
1144	Really like it. The screen is a major plus.	1
1145	Didnt think id get an Alexa device, but this is perfect for my home office.  the screen adds just that little piece that makes it worth the extra cost of the other Alexa devices.  It can show lyrics of songs, play my xm radio, can show videos of movie trailers and news.  Its great!	1
1146	I love it.  I made a group with my echo dot so I get music through my home.  I am waiting for the to go on sale again so hopefully I can get another spot for my bedroom..  I love the alarm and weather at the sound of my voice..	1
1147	When we first received this product, it was great.  However, about a week ago, the device served up a video advertisement around 10:30pm at night and scared myself and my family.  If you want to make sure you are protected and don't allow video directly in your home, the spot is not a device that can keep you safe.	0
1148	It's fun to use, and makes my life easier in some sense.	1
1149	Love it!	1

1152	I got my Echo Spot on Prime Day and love it. I think it still is a little expensive, but the chance to save $30 convinced me to buy it. I basically use it as a radio alarm clock because on my old radio the stations would sometimes not come in clearly. I also like the sleep sounds skill, and hearing the weather. I'm still exploring the other skills...just discovered some Star Trek sounds (Alexa, beam me up) which are fun!	1
1153	Love this! Replaced an old alarm clock in my bedroom with this.  Love that it dims at night. Very responsive to commands.	1
1154	Love my spot! She even more than I expected! Great size for a bedroom!	1
1155	So far so good. Just got it and I am trying to figure out all the things it can do. The product itself is very well made.. And easy to set up.	1
1156	After only a couple of days Alexa did not answer. I have disconnected and will see if it does any better after reconnecting.	0
1157	Perfect! May favorite Alexa device by far, specially if you own ring cameras or amazon cam's it does the job really well.  We changed our echo in the main living room and it seems to be more reactive. Good job Amazon!	1
1158	Is great. Use it for music mostly.	1
1159	It won‚Äôt receive calls and it‚Äôs really hard to call someone who has another echo.	1
1160	This is our first step into a smart home. Soon as I added one item to the grocery list I started loving it. My wife was so-so about it ‚Äòtil I opened rain sounds. She‚Äôs a convert. üòâ LOVE these and the dots.	1
1161	Like the little spot,  now our guest room is Alexa enabled.	1
1162	We love our echo spots. We now have three through the house and like that you can drop in on the other spots. We do wish the clock faces had more customization options and that there were more faces in general.	1
1163	It‚Äôs very smart and sweet design	1
1164	so far just ok	1
1165	Love this for bedside clock/alarm/radio.  Face can dimat night so it‚Äôs not bright for sleeping.	1
1166	Love this product I use it as my bedroom clock perfect size with a lot of other options. The only thing I would like to see them add on to it is the ability to fall asleep to mu as if and set a timer for it to go off on it's own. Like you can with tv t hcfe sleep mode.	1
1167	Love this. So glad I purchased	1
1168	I wanted to see my security video cameras without having to use my phone. Works great and extremely easy to set up.	1
1169	The Echo Spot is great!	1
1170	We bot 2 on Prime day one for use as a clock/radio in the bedroom and one in the family room to control lights and watch the front door when the doorbell rings.  Music sound is very good not as good as the Echo but way better than our Dots.  If we could only buy 1 Amazon device it would be the Spot.	1
1171	I bought two one for my office and one for my bedside table. They are fantastic the screen is just big enough when using the drop in feature to communicate with my mom. I can‚Äôt wait for prime day again to get one for my moms bedside table.	1
1172	Fantastic product, absolutely love it!	1
1173	Love these!	1
1174	I do like the product we bought it on Prime day but this week it was $30 cheaper then Prime day. Still a really cool device. I wish I would have waited.	1
1175	still learning how to ise it but is DOES NOT disappoint. I‚Äôm giving to everyone for Christmas so I can ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù on them unnannounced like they do me...just show up with no advanced warning!!!	1
1176	Very helpful with daily activities	1
1177	Exactly as advertised	1
1178	Its very nice	1
1179	More than I expected. I use it for timers, alarms, shopping lists, calendar events, news, weather, and so much more.	1
1180	Great!	1
1181	I really like it works well trivia games and shopping on it is fun.Sometimes it misunderstands what I say but other then that the speaker is decent video chat is good but you do need to be in a well lit room so the other end can see you lol.	1
1182	Fun to work with still learning everything she can do	1
1183	Awesome. I love that it shows the lyrics of songs!	1
1184	Love the alarm feature...just tell what time.	1
1185	I think the dot listens better than spot.	1
1186	Had a dot and upgraded to this! I like it. My only complaint is the very short instructions	1
1187	Big step up from the Dot! Dropped one star due to consistent delay in bringing up Ring Pro video, though looks great once the feed is displayed.	1
1188	Easy set up and to use. I bought two one for my house and one for my 75 year old grandfather. I set it up for him a gave him a 15 minute lesson and he calls me at least once a day it‚Äôs is great to be able to see him in between visits.	1
1189	I wanted to use it as a clock in our bedroom.  But the font is too small to see from any distance.  And apparently you can't change it.	0
1190	Great size for bedside. Plus it dims at night!!	1
1191	I love it and it works great, the only issue is the ‚Äúdrop in‚Äù FaceTime like feature sometimes lags, but that could possibly be an issue with my WiFi for where we have it located in the house.	1
1192	Love to have meditation music, I use it as a morning alarm, just to mention few in general I love it	1
1193	I don't know why I like it, but I do. It's like an all-in-one alarm clock.  If you have other alexa devices, you know what it is.  If you are looking to get an alarm clock, this is the one to get (yes, its much more than that).  It shows you the time, it shows you the weather, its touch screen, it shows you music lyrics, and it does all the things your typical alexa device does.  It's quite loud for its size as well (sound way better than echo dot).  It also does video calling, which is pretty awesome.  The viewing angle is great, so even if its sitting fairly high up, you can still see the display well enough.	1
1194	Quick and easy to set up	1
1195	I was hoping for a better clock face to make this an alarm clock replacement .  The display brightness dims too much at night to accomplish this task.The display works well for camera viewing.It is an attractive device. and a decent value at $99	1
1196	Great device	1
1197	I‚Äôm a fan of echo devices. I think it‚Äôs a great alternative to a clean clock. I like using it to adjust the lightning in the room and listening to sounds to help sleep. My two year old sleeps so much better with it on. We also use it to tell my two year old stories. Only issue is the volume of alexa speaking when you tell her to turn off the lights is loud when the volume is set to what you want to listen to the music at night	1
1198	I own 5 Echo devices, consider me addicted! This little number is awesome, not only do I like that it displays, the sound is great and it has the same dependable functionality as other Echo devices. One feature I really like is how it slowly dims after I turn off my bedroom light, so I have a night light for a bit. I love Echo devices and have just about run out of places to put them!	1
1199	I enjoy this little thing a lot.  Will do almost anything.  I like the jokes it tells.  I‚Äôm still learning different functions	1
1200	Meh	0
1201	Best looking Echo device. Easy to use	1
1202	A helpful product with a few glitches eg inability to occasionally access all flash briefing stations and understand or answer certain questions but Amazon will likely fix and improve it.	1
1203	we like it. very convenient	1
1204	I love the size of the echo spot. It fits on my nightstand but has all of the capabilities of my echo show. I like going to sleep with the lightening storm. The images along with the sounds are very relaxing. The calling and messaging feature is great. It‚Äôs small enough to take with when we travel. I love and own most of the Alexa products. Our whole family uses them.	1
1205	The amazon Alexa is so nice to have she wakes me up in the morning with alarms and is great if you have prime because she can do a lot more plays any songs you want her to play and she can even make playlists of your favorite songs i love the Alexa because she has games you can play ad you can watch videos or movie trailers on the screen!	1
1206	love the spot	1
1207	Easy to use easy to set up	1
1208	I love my echo spot that my daughter and son in law got me for my birthday. Alexa wakes me each morning and plays music when I ask.	1
1209	This product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable:1) There is a &#34;card&#34; on the homescreen called &#34;Things To Try&#34; -- it's an ad for other Alexa services you can try. You can turn off all the other homescreen cards, but not this one.2) By default, the homescreen cards &#34;cycle&#34; automatically, which is incredibly annoying. There is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only &#34;cycle once&#34; instead of &#34;cycle continuously&#34;, but critically *this setting does not work*. My unit has been set to &#34;cycle once&#34;, and the cards still continue to cycle all the time. Have rebooted the device, re-set, etc etc.Until these two obvious software issues are fixed, in my opinion the product is useless.	0
1210	Great deal on prime day	1
1211	no problem	1
1212	Excelente su funcionamiento y llama la atenci√≥n la rapidez de respuesta y el control que se logra a trav√©s de la utilizaci√≥n con Alexa. Me sorprendi√≥ gratamente. Muy recomendable.	1
1213	I love love it !	1
1214	Purchased this on Prime Day and I absolutely love it!  I had the Echo Dot on my nightstand, but I really missed a display. This is perfect and the speakers are excellent.	1
1215	Yes it met my expectations.  The snooze on the alarm needs a but of work.  Tap it and it snoozes, swipe up and it prompts you to dismiss.  But without my glasses I can't read it and often it just snoozes.  Then one day I must have dismissed tomorrow's alarm because it never went off.  I have it set for Mon-Thu.  Fri I don't need to get up early.  A more apparent indicator of the alarm set would be nice.  My old alarm had a red light.	1
1216	Great product, and i like the screen for a alarm clock	1
1217	Such a fun, easy, and convenient device to have around the house. No need to pick up my phone to look something up, just a few words and the world is at your fingertips. The speaker puts off great sound and the screen is crisp. The price is right for a device like this.	1
1218	A great replacement for the bedside alarm clock, which had a funny habit of going off at 12am every time the cleaning ladies came through. We mostly use it to turn the ceiling fan lights on and off, while leaving the fan running. Only gripe would be the mic sensitivity, which doesn't appear be as good as the View or Gen2. It can get a little frustrating having to repeat yourself.	1
1219	This product has made my life much simpler with a little one. I use it a lot for music and when i have my hands full turning it on/off or up/down is a breeze. The screen is a great novelty where i can watch the news!	1
1220	Works well and was easy to set up.	1
1221	Love my spot, it now acts as my new alarm.	1
1222	This is the one of my favorite Amazon devices.  Have one in my bedroom and use as alarm clock. Perfect addition to our home of Alexa devices.	1
1223	Wasn't so sure about bringing &#34;smart technology&#34; into my home, but I'm hooked! I love the sleek look of the Echo Spot on my nightstand and how easy it was to set up and use. I also love that it scrolls the news, local weather, and give suggestions of what to ask Alexa. I use this as my alarm clock, speaker, and have it sync'd with the Etekcity Voltson Wi-Fi Smart Plugs to control the lighting in my apartment.	1
1224	Love it	1
1225	You need a Harvard law degree to operate this thing! It's going back very soon!	0
1226	Love it getting use to it and Alexa is getting use to my voice . Sometimes she doesn't answer but I think it has to do when internet is low or is updating or my voice isn't strong. Over all I haven't had any of the annoying stuff that everyone is complaining about. Thank goodness I didn't listen to those reviews.  And paid attention to the Apple guy .	1
1227	product turns on randomly and sometimes at night	0
1228	I used it as an alarm clock  i lov it	1
1229	It was much smaller than I was expecting for the cost.	1
1230	I‚Äôm amazed	1
1231	Alexa wakes me up everyday for work to whatever station on Iheart radio or Spotify I want. Plus when I do get smart home devices she‚Äôll be even more useful to me! She‚Äôs really helpful with answering random questions. The small screen sucks for video as it is small and round but it‚Äôs nice to have something to show time and pictures.	1
1232	Fun so far...still learning how it all works	1
1233	I purchased this on prime day mostly as a present for myself because I found having the echo plus on my kitchen counter to be overwhelming when cooking, cutting, cleaning, etc. especially when our counters aren‚Äôt very wide to begin with. After going back and forth between this and the show I decided on this because I felt it had all the same features but is more compact. I can honestly say I have no regrets. While I probably wouldn‚Äôt watch a movie I‚Äôd been dying to see on this, it‚Äôs a great way to listen to music, watch a quick YouTube video, etc. I even attempted watching ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù on this and while it wasn‚Äôt the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do, it wasn‚Äôt as bad as one would think. I would definitely recommend!	1
1234	We love the echo spot I use it on my nightstand for alarm clock and play iHeartRadio radio while getting dressed!!	1
1235	It was easy set up.  I use it more than I thought.	1
1236	I would love this but there is no way to stop the screen from constantly scrolling through ‚Äúthings to try‚Äù. If Amazon would make this a setting I would change my review to 5 stars.	0
1237	I am a small business owner with no staff. With the Alexa driven Echo Spot, I feel like I've hired my first assistant! My Echo Spot keeps me organized, updated, and assistance when I need information that will help my day run more smoothly. I love my Echo Spot so much, I bought 2 more for my kids who love their Echo Spot too! I highly recommend this product.Suggested improvement for future versions, make the Echo Spot wireless. üòä	1
1238	Bedroom clock , ask questions,  weather reportsAlarm clock ‚è∞. Music üé∂ download music	1
1239	Speakers are not as loud as Google Home	1
1240	I haven't figured out how to make or receive calls.  Device tells me I need to register and I do not know what to do.	0
1241	I need to get some better controls for custom displays and the ability to make my own clock, but that's asking a lot. In general, great device; glad I got it.	1
1242	Great buy!	1
1243	Gave it my daughter for her birthday, she loves it! Sound is amazing, she plays music on it constantly. Worth every penny. This is the third amazon device purchased, we have 2 echo shows and now the spot.	1
1244	I use the product as an alarm clock. I love being able to set my schedule for the week and not worry about it. When images are shown, they are cut off. Little because its trying to fit it into a circle.	1
1245	Love the ease of use and convenience the echo spot has offered	1
1246	Great product and I would give 5 stars - but you can't scroll face cards without having the stupid &#34;try and ask Alexa&#34; suggestions pop up.  Yes you can have it scroll once, and just stay on the clock, but I like having other cards as well. God its the worst and SO irritating.  I got it super cheap, so i just face the screen toward the wall and treat it like a Dot instead of a Spot.  What a dumb move on Amazons‚Äã part.	0
1247	Love that I have command access to news such as Bloomberg TV, NPR, etc.Highly recommend that you gain access to Alexa app before setting up Device and get familiar with key features/services...such as setting up your daily commute.If family and friends have Spot...then it‚Äôs a great substitute for Skype and Face Time...you can always ‚Äúdrop in‚Äù when missing loved ones or just to catch up.	1
1248	good size screen and gets good range for voice commands. sometimes it picks up weird commands when I'm watching tv though. Great product for the price if you don't need the big show screen.	1
1249	It is a good addition to my small space, and it keeps me up to date on events and weather conditions.	1
1250	Best thing I have ever owned! Started with the dot and now added the spot and I love iy	1
1251	I love it the coolest thing since sliced bread	1
1252	"This product is a complete waste of money. When you ask Alexa a question ""she"" either doesn't know the answer, gives you the wrong answer or finds information off of Wikipedia!"	0
1253	Honestly it's no different from the Echo dots I already own,  other then occasionally seeing the lyrics to a song I'm listening too i really don't see the difference.	0
1254	I got this for my husband on Prime Day. He loves it as his alarm clock and smart device. This is our 3rd Echo device, and we have them all connected throughout the house. Although you can deactivate the camera, we also chose to cover it since the device is in our bedroom. I'm not comfortable with having a camera in the room (no, we don't bring our cell phones in the room).	1
1255	Great product, what they don't tell you is that once you allow a &#34;Drop In&#34;  they can drop in anytime!!!  While they are sleeping, while we are yelling at them, while anything.	1
1256	I have two. One in my computer room and the other that I move around out on the deck. Not great for watching video, but it can be done. With the added sound you don't get from the Echo Dot, it is perfect for the location I have it in. Add whole house music, and you have just arrived in Nervana.	1
1257	Surprisingly handy. Wish it had more options geared towards it being on your nigh stand. Like an even dimmer setting.	1
1258	I was on beta list for Alexa, Have a Show, an original Alexa, 4 Echo's and I actually like this the best, even more than show	1
1259	Love it!	1
1260	I was contacted by people in India. Were they suppose to charge me $79.00? It was very hard to understand their instructions. They did have control of my computer and network. I, also, bought a Cloud Cam but do not know how to make it work with Alexa.	1
1261	I have the dot and Echo Plus, this one can't seem to &#34;hear&#34; me as well and doesn't do as much as I expected.	1
1262	Bought this for our son as his birthday present and he loves it.  Often find him jamming to music in his room now  :)  He loves the options for the alarms and we have his weekday alarms set to repeat and he gets to sleep in on non-school days.	1
1263	Great product!	1
1264	I love my echo spot!	1
1265	Excellent purchase!!	1
1266	What a great little gadget for the house. You ask and it delivers, period. Well done!	1
1267	I switched to google. The amazon helper is more for shopping, and google is the tasks assistant.	0
1268	My favorite Echo. A more than adequate replacement for a clock radio.	1
1269	The Echo Spot is compact, nice sound and camera quality. Makes it great to video chat with the family when I'm travelling for work. Ease of use that the youngest member (10 years) has no problem talking to Mama on the video chat and understands the important of digital security.	1
1270	This echo spot is great I love it	1
1271	The voice recognition is amazing, perfect companion for the bedroom.	1
1272	I liked it, perfect size, the screen is really clear,  and elegant.	1
1273	I am not easily impressed with electronic goodies. But...OMG this is by far the coolest thing I have ever had.  It does everything short of clean your house... which, when I asked Alexa to clean my house.... was told she didn‚Äôt have hands, but instead played a fantastic playlist for cleaning!  From reading books to my five year old, to video chat, to silly selfies, music that automatically goes to my Bose Bluetooth speaker, setting timers, alarms, changing my thermostat on voice command, tells me the weather, sends hubby a grocery pick up list, and I am sure. Million more things!BUY IT.....you u will not regret it.	1
1274	This product is beautifully designed and I no longer have to hide an Echo device away like I did with Dot. It would be nice if Amazon would lose that camera though, which I have not used and might cause squirms for the privacy conscious.	1
1275	 	1
1276	Love this little dot with a screen.  Super easy to set up and easy to use.  Instantly connected to all my other echo products.  I also bought the screen cover that has the blocking button for the camera if you want to use it.  Recommended.	1
1277	ALEXA IS NOT AS SMART AS SIRI! CANNOT CANCEL SNOOZE AFTER ALARM GOES OFF. HAVE TO CANCEL PRE-SET ALARM FOR WEEKDAYS.	0
1278	Great product EXCEPT there is no possible way for it to act as a clock the displays the time PERMANENTLY.  When in 'Clock' mode, the screen rotates between the clock face and a 'Things to Try' screen.  I intended on buying several units for my house, but I do not need a screen in the house that is permanently trying to upset me.  Acting as clock should be a BASIC feature of the Echo Spot.  How could you get this wrong, Amazon??  #FAIL	0
1279	I wanted to use this as a bedside clock with the ability to play music and podcasts. Sadly, it continuously scrolls the &#34;Things to try&#34; and won't stay on the clock face. Amazon is about to get this one back.	0
1280	Hands free calling in the house. I misplace my cell phone all the time so this is a real blessing. Really enjoying the streaming music.	1
1281	Got for elderly parents,easy for them to use.just instructions could be more informative	1
1282	This thing is great. Fantastic alarm clock.	1
1283	We love using it for bedtime reading on Audible. It's very kid-friendly, and I can see liking it in the kitchen while I'm cooking since it's small and unobtrusive. We like it better than our Echo Dot.	1
1284	very nice gadget. love it's look.	1
1285	Not happy with the Spot.  Reset numerous times.  Seems to be in slow mode.  Have to be practically on top of it for it to hear me.  Even after talking with support I still do not have ‚Äúthemes‚Äù in the menu to choose from!	0
1286	Husband loves it!	1
1287	***Love it***	1
1288	Love the Spot - Awesome little guy with precise video - I‚Äôm saving to buy one for my mom on the east coast - The Spot changes Everything as far as keeping your loved ones connected!!!Well worth every Cent!!	1
1289	All is fine with the Spot exact for one massive failing.  In order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.  YES, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm.This is especially annoying as Amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but NOT delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off.  But as the clock has been out for a year now and they still haven't adding this setting, clearly not going to happen.  This may be the biggest product design screw up Amazon has ever made.	0
1290	Excellent	1
1291	item returned for repair ,receivded item back from repair 07/23/18 . parts missing no power cord included.please advise	0
1292	Awesome item that I had to buy two!	1
1293	For as awesome as the Echo and Echo Dots are, the Spot is a disappointment. There is very little control over what the screen shows, what the clock looks like, what order things show up in, etc. At this point if I hadn't thrown the box away immediately, I would have sent it back and just got another full size Echo.	0
1294	It has replaced my clock and Google Mini on my nightstand.  Outstanding little device.  I hope an update will give a simple face and font color options for the clock.	1
1295	I love the echo spot!	1
1296	It every ting I thought it would be plus more.  This will be going to my MOM right after I get through playing with it.	1
1297	The most fascinating thing I've ever bought	1
1298	Sound quality is less than a dot, microphones don't pick me up as well as the other models (i have Echo and Dots).  Picture quality is good	1
1299	Awesome cute and smart!	1
1300	Product forces user to review Alexa Things to Try. There is no way to disable it.	0
1301	Absolutely love it. After much persuasion from a friend, I finally gave in and bought one. Let's just say that the moment Alexa enters my life, I turn around and tell Siri to get the hell out.	1
1302	I love love love it.	1
1303	GREAT	1
1304	"This is my first Alexa device and it is so fun to discover all of the ways to use it. The biggest con with me is the ""drop-in"" feature, it's pretty creepy"	1
1305	The best thing since sliced bread!	1
1306	Can‚Äôt be used as a baby monitor which is why I had purchased it.  I didn‚Äôt realize this until I read the reviews on the Alexa skill for syncing the Nest Cam.  Considering all of the poor reviews and the fact that it should be simple to fix, surprised Amazon hasn‚Äôt upgraded the software to allow more than 39 minutes of viewing or alerts like you get on the Nest app.	0
1307	Would be 5 stars if you could turn off the &#34;Things to Try&#34; screen!!!  I should have read up on this before buying the Spot.  Amazon, please update to enable us to turn this off!  It is SO extremely annoying to look over to see the time but instead see &#34;Things to try&#34;.	1
1308	Love it. So great to use!!!	1
1309	I own 3 of these...  amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool.  You can customize the screen contents, but you cannot turn off there advertising, Things to Try...  People will suggest that you can, but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable option.Moreover, they should increase the size slightly, and improve the audio speaker.  That would give you a 5 star device.Right now i‚Äôm debating whether to return all 3 devices.  My wife says we should.	0
1310	I never thought I was going to be THAT person that is completely connected. I purchased this and another Echo product on Prime Day and fell in love.  I have one in my office and one in our kitchen.  I have already used this for morning briefings from the News while I am getting ready for the day as well as look up recipes.  The screen is big enough for me to easily read writing (this was a concern for me).  I loved this so much I purchased it for my grandparents and parents so they can easily video call me as they tend to have issues with their computer and other video conferencing tools.  Note: I did purchase camera covers (even though there is a button to &#34;turn off the camera and microphone&#34; and it doesn't impede the operations and camera so if that is what you are worried about, there are work around!	1
1311	LOVE love love this!  I have an echo, and several echo dots, but love the video with this and the clock.  I no longer have to wake up and say &#34;Alexa, what time is it?&#34; or &#34;Alexa, weather&#34;  I can even watch videos on it if i forget my kindle before bed.	1
1312	After purchasing my Echo Spot to add to our other 4 Amazon Echoes...I am very pleased with the Echo Spot...I use  it with our Arlo Security cameras and Ring video doorbell and works without any problems...	1
1313	Disconnects often	0
1314	It does so much more than I knew when I bought it. It pretty much runs my house, helps me fall asleep, takes care of my schedule, and entertainment	1
1315	Love, love so far. I just received it Thursday. I unwrapped it, set it up, & immediately programmed it. No problem with the reoccurring things to try. I set it to rotate once and shows time like I want. I love the low ambient look at night.	1
1316	This is the best Alexa enabled device you can get, it is so versatile and useful. It sound way better than the dot but not as good as the regular echo. The screen makes all the difference in the world.	1
1317	I needed an alarm clock and this fit the bill perfectly.  I am a believer in amazon echo, Alexa and fire.  Great customization options and Alexa is always helpful.  Sound quality is also surprisingly good.	1
1318	You're going to have to shell out an extra $20 bucks for the stand that should come with it so you can angle it best for how ever you are using this. My biggest gripe. I already spent an arm and a leg on this it should come with the stand.	1
1319	"Love it except that Amazon needs a reference one cohesive link for a full user manual. I don't have hours to research websites. Plus, more instruction from Alexa on skills would be great. We often get the answer, ""I don't know that skill"" even though I've added it in the app. I.e. Kwikset or Pizza Hut."	1
1320	Such a handy item to have on my night stand. She reads to me at night and gets me all set for the day in the morning with my calendar and weather views.	1
1321	 	1
1322	I got this on Prime day and figured I'd see what all the hype is about.  Honestly I didn't really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird, but honestly, I love it.  Like it or not this is the way the world is going, so why not.I loved it so much I ordered 2.  I didn't get the Show because it looks like it came from the 1990's and is downright ugly.  I have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway, so the Spot's screen does not bother me - although it is very clear.Alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere.  My favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it's hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where I can just say play any song I want and it will.  I guess I could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don't know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.The one thing that I am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  I'd love for it to display the weather as I listen to music.The screen is clear and I also really enjoy Alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  I have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  So it really works great.The one thing that I actually preferred the Dot over the Spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. I have not seen the Spot really do much for package notifications yet.  The dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  I would recommend Amazon do exactly what they did for the Dot but on the Spot - the Dot lights up colors - why can't the Spot ?  The same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.Overall it's a great device that I am looking forward to integrating my home around.  I'm already looking at dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- and = when I become a home owner instead of renting where I can't tinker with my thermostat I will be purchasing a Nest down the road for HVAC integration.	1
1323	The screen response time is way better than I expected. Sound quality is good too, also it‚Äôs not so bright that I have to turn off the screen but it is an option.  I have a Dot in another room and which ever hears me better is the one that responds.	1
1324	Love it!	1
1325	I LOOOOOOOVE this thing! :) Watching movies on it is a bit of a disaster because of the round screen, but other than that it's a GREAT chachki toy :)	1
1326	We gave the Echo Spot as a gift to my mother in law.  She loves it.  She can play music of all genres!  Easy for her to use.	1
1327	Very easy to set up. Does what is said it will. Very satisfied so far..	1
1328	Great product, need a bit a adjustment to set up spotify, time, weather, etc.. in Hong Kong, but works fine now. I used it as alarm clock + music in bedroom, love it.	1
1329	I bought this to replace a Dot in my bedroom. Already have a Show and a couple of full-sized Echo units in my house.The Spot is okay for what it is. Two issues, one minor and one major:-the minor one - why include the huge bezel on the front? Why not take that space and make the display larger? A total waste of usable space.-the major one, also involves the Show: I'm very used to these devices. I don't need to see &#34;Things to Try&#34; whenever I use a voice command with it (even setting it to rotate once starts this crap over again when you dare to actually use the devices). I'm not a child and I don't need to be told a hundred times how to play music on it. And having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tips is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed. Why doesn't Amazon fix this and give us the option to turn this nonsense off? I want to see a clock face, period, not these silly nanny reminders.	1
1330	This product just looks adorable in any room and I love it. I recently just bought my mom one as a gift on Prime Day and she can't wait to use it.	1
1331	love my spot	1
1332	Loving this way more than google home devices. I've been using for a couple months and if you're an amazon prime subscriber the value here is greater than google. I'm using to listen to free music with prime (better than alternatives), audible and you can even watch movies. The display is a little small for lots of watching, the sound should be louder, and YOUTUBE NEEDS TO BE AVAILABLE. These issues put this at a 3.5 to 4 stars. Fix one of them (youtube) and its a 5 star item. To alleviate sound I've paired with a blue tooth speaker. Right now this sits in my living area. Where I think it will shine is my office desk. Once there are great offers I could see purchasing additional for nightstand or other Amazon Alexa items for my household. I felt happy after adding this to my house where as I felt stupid using google home.	1
1333	I like it as an Alexa device but its small.	1
1334	What a wonderful little Alexa enabled gadget at like the analog clock face the best	1
1335	Love it, Love it, Love it!!! Bought it on Prime Day, then had buyers remorse, but once I got it, it was Love at first sight.	1
1336	I like the Echo Spot because it fits into my decor and I can also sing along with my favorite songs	1
1337	Best bedside clock and assistant I have ever had.	1
1338	Omg where do I start, I LOVE THIS THING! None bad to say!	1
1339	Works as described.  A+++++	1
1340	Get rid of the &#34;Thongs To Try&#34; screen!!!!!!!!!! Numb nuts!!!!!	0
1341	Have not used it yet. But I'm sure it's as great as the others.. I can not get over how amazing the echo , echo dots are. This has to be some of the greatest technology that has ever came out.	1
1342	I am very excited and happy with this. It was a breeze to set up and my favorite feature is reading my Kindle and going to sleep to Thunderstorm music.	1
1343	Still learning to use these things.  They sure are smart!  haha  She started reading a book to me yesterday.  Get one.  I like the way it controls the brightness all by itself when lights are turned off at night.	1
1344	I highly recommend the spot! I have it connected to the kasa camera and it is so convenient to just ask spot to, &#34;show me the camera&#34; when someone is at the door. Love it! As soon as amazon has a good sale on these again I will be getting another one! Good job Amazon!	1
1345	The echo works fine but then you get indundated with &#34;Things to try&#34;. I am not a 10 year old that needs stimulus to tell me to do things. I found there is no way to turn this off except for .... turning off the screen. If I cannot find a suitable fix for this it goes back.	0
1346	Great to wake up to music and being told the weather.	1
1347	Bought this to replace a Sony Dash (remember those?) after Sony decided to pull support from it entirely. It works great for what I use it for: an alarm clock, a weather station, background music player and voice control of lights throughout my house. My biggest gripe about the device and why I knocked a star off is that you can't turn off the suggestions on &#34;Things to Try&#34;. It 's an annoying and a stupid design decision since you have control to turn off other things you don't want to see as it cycles through content screens. A software update or two would help this improve especially full control of what we want and don't want to see in the content rotation.	1
1348	Can't turn of &#34;things to try&#34; on the screen scroll. This  is a big promotion device for Amazon.  Packing it up and sending it back.  They really want to get in our heads.  Enough already.	0
1349	Love everything about this product I bought two one for my household and one for my mother in law just so we can video chat with her and for emergency and it‚Äôs easy to use for older folks.	1
1350	This thing woke me up in the middle of the night saying ‚Äúready for setup‚Äù. It was already setup. Should be a simple thing to check  time before asking. Wife not happy...	0
1351	The echo spot is really great. I just got it and is easy to set up. I do have one problem. When the advertise it they show a screen with the time weather and your town. Sadly there is no way to make this the home screen. The home screen is just the timeüòî. I spoke to support and the wonderful lady tried and researched for 45 minutes to no avail. I am disappointed because I wanted that screen all the time not just during an occasional screen rotate. I am hoping they will do something about this. Other than that it‚Äôs great	1
1352	The product is attractive and somewhat useful, BUT, Amazon chose to force users to view their ‚Äúthings to try‚Äù and Trending‚Äù.  This greatly depreciates the value of the product.  Do not buy unless you are willing to view a billboard from Amazon.	0
1353	The Echo Spot has really helped me to streamline my day and be more efficient! It reminds me of any appointments, warns me about traffic snarls, and tells me the weather every day while suggesting new music and introducing me to new artists.	1
1354	 	1
1355	Come on - it's amaonmazing!  It's way more than a smart speaker.  It's my wake-up alarm, my security blanket, and infotainment center all-in-one.  It's my connection to the world during night hours when I'm mostly sleepy or zonked-out Zzzzzzz...  I can still access the world without my reading-glasses late at night.  It sounds amazing for its size.  It can hear me when I'm far from awake (mostly).  As they say, &#34;this is a must-have device&#34;.  Yep, that is a true statement.	1
1356	Got one for me and for my son on Prime Day. We love them! I want one in every room, but that would be excessive.	1
1357	In one word: Amazing! Best tech purchase I have ever made as it controls all devices in my house and even my pool!	1
1358	I‚Äôm leaving this for those who don‚Äôt have enough of an attention span to read instructions.  You can stop the screen rotations.Swipe down on clock screenSelect settingsHome & clockHome cardsRotate onceProblem solved	1
1359	Very nicely constructed. My wife wanted a second for the kitchen so I order a second one.	1
1360	 	1
1361	I love this little gadget, replaces my old clock basically, love i can listen to music in the morning get weather updates, news briefs.  Let's me know when a amazon order is arriving & has been delivered etc.  Yes it's a little pricey, but purchased it on Amazon Prime Now during Prime Day and it was delivered same day for $99.	1

1363	I love my little Echo Spot, I have replaced my older full size echo with this little guy. The round screen is an interesting choice and I'm not sure I like the look but it is growing on me. The speakers could be slightly louder but all in all it is a solid echo product.	1
1364	It's not as good as Siri, BUT it still has some positives, it's great at playing music, and setting alarms. I personally felt that I paid too much for this product, as it was nearly half off on prime day (literally the day after I purchased it). So I'm pretty disappointed. I might still return it and get my money back. .	0
1365	Having received this as a gift, I am writing my initial thoughts: (compared to my google home mini)PROS:  Way easier to setup than the google home mini.  I was able to connect ALL of my smart home device (unlike google) without any issues.  Making phone calls on this was clearer for the receiver to understand me.CONS:  Need to enable 'skills' to get more functionality.  Google home has built in functionality to search the web for answer to questions easier than  the amazon echo.  Could not connect this to youtube.	1
1366	Love it	1
1367	Well-made product.Echo Spot - White	1
1368	Installed on my back porch, works very well!  I did have to get the wall mount for it, which also works well.	1
1369	Thank God, and alarm clock with an lcd that gets dim enough for me to sleep. I'm a very light sensitive sleeper and wind up taping black tape over all my other stuff in my bed room. Not this guy. The Alexa features are nice and listening to music at night is great. We enjoy falling asleep to meditation podcasts though we have to use the skill anypod to get the podcasts we like. Video is kinda tiny and useless at this size but that's to be expected. Audio quality is much better than echo dot.	1
1370	I love this thing. At first I thought it wouldn‚Äôt stay on the clock and that I would have to suffer through ads forever but when the lights are off it sits on the clock and it‚Äôs very comfortable for the eyes, easy set up. Love it	1
1371	Got it and, as expected, ITS GREAT! Almost a swell as my SHOW.	1
1372	Love this thing. People think I‚Äôm crazy for paying this much for a glorified alarm clock. But I don‚Äôt care!! For me, waking up in a good mood is pretty important and this helps me do it!! So glad I don‚Äôt have to deal with my old EEAANH EEAANH EEAANH alarm. Very excited to say ‚ÄúAlexa, turn off the lights‚Äù (smart plugs get here soon!) Got a camera privacy slide for this since it is in my bedroom.	1
1373	I absolutely love this! Very user friendly and I got the Kasa Cam to go with it to monitor my living room. Super easy to set up and operate. I only wish it actually came with the camera privacy cover and pivoting stand which you can buy separately. I‚Äôm looking forward to future software updates for different clock faces. I like digital but I miss the colon in between the hours and minutes on most of them. I‚Äôd also like to see more celebs jump on board for the alarm voices. I really have no complaints, I‚Äôm being nit picky at this point. Worth every penny!	1
1374	Surprisingly good beefy sound out of this thing. I think it might shape up to be one of my favorite echo devices. I have nearly all of them. ;-)	1
1375	Given as a gift to my wife, to compliment my echo.  She loves it.	1
1376	This is a gift.  But I have one and love it.  The words to songs are great and the I live the face I chose for the clock.  This is my favorite echo (unless I am listening to music).	1
1377	I‚Äôve had this for a little over 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it! It‚Äôs so easy to use. I‚Äôm basically using it as a smart alarm but it can do way more. The screen quality is great and it looks super cute sitting on my night stand. I don‚Äôt know how I lived without it so long. If you can‚Äôt decide whether to buy it or not, GO FOR IT! You won‚Äôt regret it!!	1
1378	Fairly useless.	0
1379	Bought the spot and loved it. Within months it started acting funny and would stop working‚Äîcalled and they determined that it was overheating. I was told to unplug and technical support would call within 24-48 hours. Waited 48 hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week. A week goes by with absolutely no response so I do the inline chat per instructions. Told to wait longer. REALLY????  Unacceptable‚Äîexpected more from Amazon. Find it funny how they always thank me for being a Prime member but when an issue arises I cannot even get assistance.	0
1380	Much easier to use than the dot. It picks up my voice from farther away and the speakers seem a lot cleaner sounding The screen is a nice perk but I only use it at bed time to listen to prime shows before bed, the screen is too small to watch shows..It displays my alarm in print so I know Alexa heard me correctly. and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures.  My only complaint is that they don't add the stand as standard. I didn't need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bed.Many people complain about the basic Alexa program but it is still such new tech that I'm not going to split hairs.  The echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot.  Alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing weekly. Now Alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice. I think Amazon is working overtime on this project. I gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anything.I am so used to my Alexa that I talk to her even when I'm staying in a hotel and she's no where to be found.  Alexa, what time is it?  ALEXA???!!	1
1381	When we were buying another product there was an option to bundle this one for an extra $30...so we thought why not? Well, I'm so glad we did! We are really enjoying our Echo Spot. It reads stories to our girls, plays music, gives us the news, and so much more!  It's so responsive and has so many skills that we enjoy.	1
1382	For the size of the screen this thing should be $25	0
1383	This is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock.  I use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  Audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  Much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  It doesn‚Äôt seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  Try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying ‚ÄúAlexa set an alarm for 5am‚Äù and then having Alexa repeat ‚ÄúOK alarm set for 5am.‚Äù  Not good.  I suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  Plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990‚Äôs and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  I know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  No thanks, if I‚Äôm picking up my phone to set an alarm I will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  At least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  The interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  There should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  Currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  It is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  When the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning Alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while I‚Äôm in the shower.	1
1384	I bought this for my mother and she loves it! I want to get one for myself now!	1
1385	 	1
1386	Invasive and scared the crap out of me for speaking when it was not spoken to! CREAPY AF	0
1387	4 out of 5 stars. I have the Original Tall Echo, 4 dots, 2 spots and 1 Show.  The only thing I'm finding a problem with is the speakers in the Spot. when using Drop In.  Sometimes I'm not being heard on the other spot and vice versa.  The voices tends break up or the sound coming through is intermittent. The optical is fine........ it's just the sound. Sometimes I'll have to repeat the wake word 2-3 times and I'm only 8 feet away plus it's on one of those $20 stands.  I find the ECHO DOT, Original echo and the Show has much better sound quality.  That's one reason I bought the Echo Show.	1
1388	I bought this for my 90 year old grandmother and she and I love it!!! She can call all her family members with just her voice, play games, even watch a video and I love that I can ‚Äúdrop in‚Äù on her any time to see how she is doing. She lives all by herself. And I feel comfortable if there was an emergency she could call out to Alexa for help!!	1
1389	 	0
1390	I love this thing! It plays my books from audible or prime music and sets my alarms! If you‚Äôre considering purchasing one, get it. It‚Äôs worth it.	1
1391	I think it can read my mind	1
1392	Perfect	1
1393	Love my spot! My favorite feature is the &#34;Alexa, start my day.&#34; I love that I can hear the weather, traffic and even the word of the day! It even goes right into my favorite podcast while I get dressed!	1
1394	Works. Replaced my expired bedside radio/alarm.It took me a while to realize that option setting involved using it as a touch screen.Maybe it should said something during the setup process.	1
1395	Works great I love it, grand daughter digs the watching of cartoons on it lol	1
1396	Gift for husband.  Great!	1
1397	I had just said to myself how I desired an assistant when I came across the Spot!  As a Mom of two things can get hectic really quickly trying to manage everyone‚Äôs schedules & my own. I just verbally tell Alexa what reminder or timer I need set and Voila!Having my Spot has given me the virtual assistant I so desired without having to actually hire someone.  Not to mention the many other awesome features. I have Alexa synced with my Audible & Kindle & Alex can read a book from my libraries to me.I‚Äôm still excited to see what else my Spot can do!Side note: I had wanted to purchase a Show for a while & probably still will down the line however I sooooo love my sleek little Sopt!	1
1398	I love the product , but very disappointed once I  realized I can no longer play youtube videos.  I'm now past my 30 days return date.  I am realizing I now have an expensive alarm clock.  I am hoping youtube comes back.  I was looking to buy an echo show for the kitchen during prime day. Glad I didn't.	0
1399	I‚Äôm not sure why or how Amazonia asking me about this purchase. I got it as a gift from my kids for Mother‚Äôs Day...  It was not bought from my account. Lil bit creepy üòë. I haven‚Äôt really had much use for it as no one calls, they text. So that part meh. The other things it does are no different than the other Alexa products.	1
1400	I love love love love it!  I feel like I have a talking computer that tells me EVERYTHING.	1
1401	Love the Echo Show.  Being able to see the lyrics of the songs as they play or to be able to put a recipe up on the screen is wonderful!!	1
1402	It seems to work well.  Unfortunately a lot of the functionality is lost because, as many have mentioned, it does not work with google or Youtube any more.  This problem is caused by Google because they came up with their own devices an no longer allow access from other devices like these.  This even effected my smart TV.  Anyhow we purchased a few of these to communicate with our children and grandchildren so we'll see what happens when we hand them out.	1
1403	Love listening to music. Still trying to learn everything it does.	1
1404	Very pleasedSimple to figure out	1
1405	just what I expected,already have 2 other  shows	1
1406	Very good	1
1407	Excellent to listen to my music, my audio books, and look all my cameras in and around my house.	1
1408	Alexa is fun! I‚Äôve added smart home aspects, my friend listens to Spotify, my husband enjoys interacting too.	1
1409	Tremendous way to communicate with friends and family all across the country	1
1410	It,is,what it is and than some. Sounds great too. On,y thing I dont like the camera being seen by anyone working for amazon  I asked echo show to show me camera and didn‚Äôt know what I was saying but knows how to turn camera on and off but can‚Äôt dhiw u what‚Äôs recording hmm	1
1411	Used for personal use. We like hearing weather, news from CNN, and various playlists.	1
1412	Love it!	1
1413	I like the echo show its the best! big screen you can watch movies preview from the movie and alexa will answer all your question you name it.	1
1414	Prime day pricing was good, but the show is very limited.  No video services available except Amazon Video.  No Netflix or YouTube.  Alexa is very limited also, not nearly as useful as Google.	1
1415	works great, has great picture easy to setup and use..	1
1416	The fact that she can help me find my phone when I am at home alone is worth the price of this device	1
1417	I LOVE THIS ITEM... I UNDERESTIMATED THIS ITEM, I HAVE ANOTHER 2 IN MY CART ... BUT I'M WAITING FOR THE SAME DEAL AGAIN!!!, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM!	1
1418	I love using my Echo Show for music, it sounds amazing! Unfortunately the video quality when video chatting isnt great, my husband and I video chat often and his video comes out very clear on my end but he says my image is very pixelated. I'm still learning to use it but so far so good.	1
1419	Love it!	1
1420	 	1
1421	Oh I love my Echo Show and the video news spots	1
1422	Waste of money over the echo generation 2.  You don‚Äôt really get anything more from a video chat on this device then you would on FaceTime or Skype and it does not cycle through your pictures when you put it on slideshow mode it sticks on the first photo and will not leave it no matter what you do I have even looked online to research articles and cannot find a solution.  I have also had problems with this device shutting down and I have not had these problems on any of the other echo devices.  Price difference is just not worth it	0
1423	No you tube wouldn't have bought it if I known that	0
1424	This is our second echo show.  We have a home in Mexico and one in the USA.  Now when one of us is in the other home we can easily stay in touch and see each other.  We can also drop in on the houses when we aren‚Äôt there to check on them.  We use it to turn on and off the lights and security systems in both homes.  We also have echo dots in various rooms.  We love all this technology!  We ask her many questions and she plays music for us.	1
1425	Needs to play YouTube and prime video and maybe Netflix. But it has good sound	1
1426	We love our Echo Show!	1
1427	Great product	1
1428	I love this device. I upgraded from the Echo Spot. I just wish I could customize the clock on my screen to analog, to mimic what I was used to in the echo spot. Also, there is better sound quality on this device.	1
1429	Love this thing.. Best toy I've bought myself in awhile.. So far I have a smart plug connected running my Ac.  And the wifi light bulbs.  Baseball scores, weather are  cool but the music is the best feature.	1
1430	This thing is a lot cooler than I thought it would be.  I mostly have used it to read me audiobooks, but I also love that I can see into the camera while I'm at work.	1
1431	I‚Äôm really enjoying this product. Love the flash briefing, the timers, the weather reports and more.	1
1432	We love the Show.  It loses the connection every now and then but not sure if that is an Show issue or our internet issue.  But overall we use it for many applications.	1
1433	Works well with optional cameras.  Conferencing is good.  Still feel like Bezos is spying on me.	1
1434	I can connect my smart lights and my phone. And any other smart device. It's just so convenient that I highly reccomend it to anyone who have the disposable income.	1
1435	Love, love, LOVE!!!	1
1436	Love all my Echo products. I like the video phone feature on this. Can check in on our cat when on vacation.	1
1437	Works exactly how you would expect, right out of the box. I love being able to not only hear, but now see, what I need on this device. I loved my regular echo, but the Show is just so much better!  It works wonderfully for music (especially paired with the Amazon music account) and is perfect with my ring doorbell. Love it!	1
1438	I absolutely LOVE this!!!  I have it in my kitchen so I can use it for cooking. The speakers are amazing!!!	1
1439	I've only had this a week but so far so good.  We are enjoying it.	1
1440	Love the product idea. Super easy to set up & get started, a breeze to do routine tasks (set alarms, timers, add items to shopping/to do lists, play music, get news, just about anything it's supposed to do). The sound is good where Imhave it sitting, not tinny at all as some have found. There is one thing I HATE & it would keep me from recommending it to anyone - you cannot delete from the nice screen the continually running suggestions of what to ask Alexa. Unless you have her turn off the screen totally which I do when I go to bed. And it's too bad bc it's like a continuously running advertisement or set-up guide. Not attractive. The echo show was on sale prior to Prime day for less than the Echo, so I figured I was getting a great deal for my money when trying to decide which device to start out with. Because of the ever present script it's not a nice device to look at, I would not buy it again, or recommend - go with the Echo. I may still exchange the product.	1
1441	Very excited to see what it can do	1
1442	"This is great for music, video calling, kitchen timers, and probably a bunch more. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the ever-floating ""things to try"" on the home screen. This is purely an aesthetic complaint, but hopefully soon Amazon allows the option to shut it off."	1
1443	I love the idea is the star trek computer at home. The skills are great, but the natural language work is mediocre.	1
1444	Got this as a gift... so cool!  I can view my news, recipes or shopping lists.  And much more!!!	1
1445	I do love it. Was easy to set up so far, but I wish it has a little more in the set up instructions. There is still a whole lot more I would like to be able to do with it and I have no idea if I can or not with it. But I really do like it.	1
1446	This is my second one. I have one in the kitchen and wanted another in my home office.It is amazing for a quick look up while I am working. I live a very busy life and it helps keep me on track with work and personal appointments.I will buy for holiday gifts for my whole family. The gift of organization and information at a voice command away.	1
1447	 	0
1448	Don't waste your money.  I own an echo gen 1, and echo gen 2 and a dot. They all do a far better job of voice recognition that the Echo Show.  In fact, it is so bad that it is virtually useless.  Also, the speaker is incredibly bass heavy....so much so that it is hard to understand voices.  I've worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble, but it still sounds awful.  Finally, the screen just doesn't add much.  I can't see if from across the room, it rarely activates in any meaningful way, and when it doesn't, it is more of a distraction than a help.(Using FaceTime is so much more practicalthan using the Show.) I'm surprised Amazon didn't make this a little more useful than it is.  Perhaps in the future, but for now, it is a waste of time and money.	0
1449	I love it. It does everything.	1
1450	Thought it would be more powerful and have a lot more functionality. Not much better than the Echo dot. Not worth the money.	0
1451	I purchased echo about 2 weeks ago , I love this product, I would definitely recommend	1
1452	I'm loving my new Echo Show. The video screen adds so much more value and potential. Movies, tv shows, song lyrics, all extra features that are available with the Echo Show. Oh, it also has a built in camera for taking pics.	1
1453	My wife has been using Skype for years to talk to her parents daily, with constant technical issues.  Since her father is 88, it's a lot to ask the man to uninstall/reinstall/reconfigure Skype, but he does.  When I saw these on sale, I jumped on them.  My wife was resistant to &#34;learn a new technology&#34;, but I told her these just work - like the video phones I saw at the New York World's Fair in 1964 - 54 years ago!Yesterday it set up quickly and worked fine, with no issues.  My wife told her co-worker today and she went out and bought 3 - one for herself and her husband, and one for each set of parents.  It just works, like a telephone - imagine that.	1
1454	Bluetooth sound is great. Videos are crazy. It‚Äôs an amazing device.	1
1455	Great item for knowledge, directions, music,laughter and more	1
1456	very nice-needs some work	1
1457	Very cool!	1
1458	Enjoy using it.  Great sound.  Love the shopping list	1
1459	The Echo Show is ok, however the constant suggestions about what to ask Alexa are sooooo annoying and there is no way to eliminate it. Also, I thought I could have the weather for an area displayed continuously,  but I have to talk to Alexa, which I don't want to do in the middle of the night. Had I payed full price it would have been returned. There are other features that are nice, but I may never use them.	1
1460	We held off purchasing an Echo but couldn't resist during Prime Days.  The Echo works great and it's nice to have the screen.  There is still a lot more we need to learn how to do.	1
1461	 	1
1462	Love it very much, still learning everything that my Echo can do, but am really enjoying the whole process.	1
1463	Love it!! Still learning all the possibilities.	1
1464	I love the echo show awesome speakers I love the fact when you listen to music the words come up all around liking it so far. Also being able to read what's on your shopping list to do list and notifications	1
1465	Nice works great	1
1466	Easy to set up and sooooooo many things it can do.  Just awesome!	1
1467	Met every expectation I had	1
1468	I like it	1
1469	Unit is working great, but it is a true PIA that products today are shipped without user manuals. Do manufacturers truly believe that user will magically know the full capabilities of each product purchased? I have no idea of the echo show's capabilities. I have it linked to my Hue lights, but have no idea what commands will work, and what won't. I purchased a Fire TV Stick along with the Show, but have no idea how to maximize the two. Just a few examples.I even purchased a text that other users have found to be helpful. Seems way too basic to me, but better than a kick in the pants.	1
1470	It's a fun item to have.  Has a lot of udefulness.  Big negative is that it doesn't use Google (or any real search engine) to get answers or find information.	1
1471	I was pleasantly surprised! It‚Äôs awesome so far	1
1472	Alexa Show is amazing. My wife hated that I bought it, thought we didn't need it and after a day she fell in love with Alexa too lol. It is so convenient for setting timers, listening to music, playing music for the dog while im not home, connecting to bluetooth speakers for parties, playing movies. I love it!	1
1473	Do not understand all the excitement over these alexa devices or the google ones either.  It rarely gets what I say correct, does not control the Dish receiver.  Yes I set it up correctly, using the alexa app on my phone.  We got this for 129,  which is a good deal, ti is definately not worth the 229 price though.  Maybe in another month it will get better, or either I have one that is just deaf and dumb.  Really can not recommend this item at the current time	0
1474	It makes talking with your grandchildren so easy, especially for the little ones.  Outstanding product!	1
1475	Great product.	1
1476	I already had purchased the Echo and a couple of Dots and hesitated to purchase this until the price dropped.  I am very glad I did.  The versatility of the video screen is outstanding.  No regrets!	1
1477	"I purchased the ""Show "" to keep in touch with my daughter and her family after their recent move half way across the country.  It is wonderful seeing their faces during our conversations."	1
1478	My difficulty is I dont have a cell phone,and now you cant download the alexa app on a Mac book air.  SO I am stuck, unable to program my echo show properly. In my opinion you should be able to tell the echo show what you need done. and the echo show does it. every time i ask for something I am referred back to the alexa app.on your mobile device, which I cannot access.To me this is not intelagence but dependence on other equipment to function.Every thing today is pushed to the phone,  because the phone has been made accessable,  to all those who wish  to gather information	1
1479	Great in the kitchen.  I love to cook and it is fun to look up recipes.  Also great for listening to music and watching shows on Amazon Prime Video while I cook.  I subsequently bought an Echo Dot with the ihome clock docking station for the bedroom.  I created a group so I can play music on both of them at the same time.  I plan to add more speakers in the future.	1
1480	Excellent quality, very good sound, great deal on Prime Day.	1
1481	So far so good.  Neat to have a visual version of alexa's responses. Nice to see the lyrics of music you are listening to.  Flash briefings have good videos.  Speaker is much better than a dot but not the highest quality	1
1482	It‚Äôs fun	1
1483	fun so far. learning to use her.	1
1484	works great.. nice sound and picture	1
1485	This product is even better than I imagined. I love the timer setting, it reminds me to put the clothes in the dryer if i ask it to, and i love shopping list feature.  My family enjoys the games too! It‚Äôs made my life a little more easy! Alexa is my personal assistant. :)	1
1486	I love it.	1
1487	Very disappointed.  Alexa doesn‚Äôt hear me and doesn‚Äôt respond to my requests.	0
1488	Highly like my eco show.no complaints	1
1489	love it! so glad we got it on Prime Day, although now having it, I would totally pay full price for it!	1
1490	Great addition to the Alexa family.  Nice having the &#34;visual&#34; part of pics, recipes, etc.	1
1491	We love it!!  We use it every day and are finding new ways to use it the longer we have it!	1
1492	I have been through 4 Shows now.  And ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN BROKEN.  It has been anything from screens that lose lines of resolution to timers and reminders going off an hour late or reminders that trigger when trying to set other reminders.  I don't have these issues on my Dot or my Echo.  Just on the Show.  It would be nice if Amazon could get there act together and actually fix this thing.	0
1493	Easy set up	1
1494	Pleased with the Echo, it is loud and can hear my voice and understand much better than previous versions.	1
1495	Love it!  Great to request music and be able to see lyrics.  I had a dot, but this is so much better.	1
1496	What we liked most was actually seeing the words to song. Least would be I guess I expected a little more from her than is currently available.	1
1497	I‚Äôm just learning about this product, but what I know I love !	1
1498	Easy to use!	1
1499	it does what it needs to.	1
1500	I love this product.  I'm not very computer literate but everything is voice controlled.  I use this to keep in touch with my daughter, she lives out of town.  Now we just drop in on each other. It's like we are living net door to each other.	1
1501	I enjoy seeing lyrics on the screen for different Amazon music stations	1
1502	love the Echo show great in  kitchen  for recipes	1
1503	Alexa is pretty dumb ,,,	0
1504	Only problem is my slow internet. I really like the speaker on it. Having tons of fun with it	1
1505	Love my Echo Show. Alexa is amazing and now on the Show &#34;she&#34; can display lyrics, photos, etc. The speakers are amazing and fills the room. Bought on Prime Day so got a great deal, so worth it.	1
1506	LOVE MY ECHO SHOW.  Everything about this device is wonderful	1
1507	Used to have fun with. Great to play music, turn on lights and who know what else.	1
1508	Works great , seems to be a delay bringing up ring cameras but sound and video quality are good	1
1509	Works on great i  use it with my Arlo security system	1
1510	this is so fun! I really enjoy using it. I have it hooked up to one of my lights so I just tell Alexa when I want that on and off. also, it connects to my Spotify so I just have Alexa resume my playlist and we pick off right where we ended. I feel like there's even more I can do with this, so I'm excited to use it more!	1
1511	Upgraded from an original Echo on Prime Day and so far I love it. I'm sure I have a long way to go to maximize its utility,  but for now I owe my marked increase in lyrical knowledge to this thing. Who knew Post Malone actually used words?!	1
1512	You can't access YouTube! Why do consumer's have to pay for this argument! Why can't we just have a good product that offers what we need?	1
1513	 	1
1514	Still learning about the Echo show but so far we love it. My 9 year old loves to cook and especially with his Aunt that lives out of state and now he can connect with her and they cook together.	1
1515	I love having this on my desk. The fact that I can video with friends, listen to music with the words right there, and see my Amazon Cloud Cam feeds from one location is pretty spectacular. I got this one sale too, which was stellar. It has me thinking I need another one for the front room.	1
1516	Love it!	1
1517	Love my echo show! Great sound and picture. Does a great job thing in my entire echo collection!	1
1518	Can‚Äôt change voice of Echo	1
1519	Does everything I could ask and more. Great product.	1
1520	I like how clear the screen is. Hi resolution	1
1521	It is so easy to use and is everything I hoped for	1
1522	I love the Echo Show. I‚Äôm going off to live on campus for school in the fall and we got two of these to serve as an easy way to connect. Some people might not like the camera but that makes little sense. We carry devices with cameras all the time. The only difference here is that the item is stationary. My family and I also find the drop-in feature a comfort rather than an invasion of privacy. It‚Äôs definitely a source of relief to my parents that they can so easily pop in onme and visa versa.I‚Äôd also like to thank Amazon for including their VoiceView screen reader on the device. The Show would be a lot less blind friendly, even with Alexa present, if they hadn‚Äôt included that.We are an echo-loving household with two dots, three echos, and now two Shows. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we got more in the future for ourselves or loved ones. Thanks, Amazon!	1
1523	I love it it is awesome	1
1524	Very Good to be able to listen to Every single song at any time in Amazon's vast library. We're only just beginning to know everything Echo Show has to offer. Well worth the price!! Alexa is very helpful.	1
1525	Love it!	1
1526	Great sound and the screen is nice to actually see time, trivia, etc.	1
1527	This has been perfect for being able to see my canary cameras and that‚Äôs exactly what I wanted! I have been happy with all my Alexa‚Äôs because we have several and this is a great addition.	1
1528	I really love this item!  So much fun!	1
1529	I agree ...YouTube should be on there.	1
1530	We like it a lot, sound is better than the original echo, the bass feels deeper.  The screen is cool, though, havent got a lot of use out of it though.	1
1531	Good sound! The capacity of join different apps to make work your smart home	1
1532	Great addition to the Alexa family, just wish it could use the screen more than backgrounds. Don't get me wrong I don't regret buying it especially for the primeday sale of $100 off sale price but for now the skills for the show are lacking.	1
1533	I've had previous experience with the echo Dot and this just blows all previous expectations out of the water!It's great since it can play videos and music from multiple sources and the speakers are pretty loud.	1
1534	Love the echo show, can keep I can video chat with the kids and grandkids. I have it in the kitchen, so when I run out of something I have Alexa to add it to my grocery list. I use it for everything. Was very easy to set up	1
1535	I‚Äôm really hoping for skills that take advantage of the shows touch screen. There‚Äôs an incredible amount of untapped potential locked behind the restrictions. Make use of the best part of having the show and enable skills to navigate by touch please!	1
1536	Love it l. I plan on getting an echo for the kitchen.	1
1537	It does not pick up my voice unless I yell most times.	1
1538	great love it	1
1539	Amazing!	1
1540	Fire HD does so much more.  Over priced pair of speakers.	0
1541	Seems to be a good product but, unable to play music in sync with my Sonos system. Sonos doesn't seem to recognize it at all.	1
1542	Great product.  Like the apps that I can connect to it.	1
1543	I love it now able to talk to my grandson with ease and the picture quality is great	1
1544	Love it! Easy setup and I can ‚ÄòDrop in‚Äô on my daughter and son-in-law who live in St. Louis anytime. Everyone loves to have their mother drop in, right üòé	1
1545	Fun	1
1546	I use this to control my smart home.	1
1547	Show has been great. Still learning what it can do, but being able to watch videos, talk face to face with others are not features.	1
1548	Wish I bought one for work too	1
1549	Very intrusive, so I turn it off	0
1550	Love the echo show	1
1551	Works well. Not thrilled that most of the apps have to be paid for seprately.	1
1552	Video calls to Mom	1
1553	Love being able to see, as well as hear things.  Sound is better, too!	1
1554	I love it	1
1555	Just like any other echo. Doesn‚Äôt disappoint	1
1556	Nice picture good sound but the mics are not as sensitive as a dot, my dots can hear me from across the house the Show does not, that being said I LOVE the show!!I can watch TV and movies while in tg ed kitchen, have the News playing or Music....love....it !!	1
1557	I basically use it to play music  and tell me the news..its sometimes hard to communicate with it, if i dont say the command correctly, but i realize its learning my style of speaking and will do some commands even though i dont say them exactly as i should.	1
1558	 	0
1559	Upgraded from echo to echo show.	1
1560	"I love the Echo Show!! I have the dot and have been using that for the last 6 months,  but the Show is so much better.  The sound quality is amazing and the screen resolution is like watching a mini 4K tv.  I love being able to see my timers, events and list instead of having them read to me.  I purchased this on prime day, and it is worth every penny.  When the dot was given to me, I thought ""this is a cute novelty,  but I'll probably never use it"". Was I wrong!!  Echo is part of my daily routine,  and has made my life so much easier."	1
1561	So far I‚Äôm very pleased with my Echo Show.  The problem is, there‚Äôs so much it can do that I haven‚Äôt been able to explore the extent of its abilities! I got the special price as part of the Prime Day promotion...and you just can‚Äôt beat what you get for the price.  Very pleased with the sound. The video screen is sharp. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get Alexa to perform a command...but as I get to know the system better, I‚Äôm hoping that will improve.  One drawback in the music...I‚Äôve noticed a lot of the songs from years past, are re-recordings by the original artist...but not the original recording itself.  Example: Secret Agent Man by Johnny Rivers...a ‚Äúlive‚Äùversion is used, not the original version.  If I‚Äôm going to pay for Prime Music...I‚Äôd like to hear the original version of songs...not later recordings.  Or at least give me a choice of what I want to hear.  Otherwise, I am very pleased with my Echo Show.  So pleased in fact, that I bought a second one!	1
1562	I like everything, about this ! Im still learning how to use it!	1
1563	It's like having another kid in the house; I have to constantly repeat myself.I can tell Alexa to do something clear as day, and according to the history, she hears something comeletely different.The device is really cool, and I like the concept, which is why it gets two stars. However, it just doesn't work as intended.I find myself irritated more often than not when I use this device.	0
1564	Really easy to use	1
1565	It's great sound and video quality	1
1566	The way the music sounds is poor quality	0
1567	It does everything the Echo does, and more. Although I haven't and probably won't use the video functions. I had hoped that the display would be allow for more customization. It does not and is very limited. I would like the clock and weather to display in large text all of the time, it only displays in very small text. It also always has a line that says &#34;Tell Alexa to do this, or that&#34;, tips at the bottom of the screen. I would like to see that go away, but it won't. Sound quality is good, not as good as the big Echo, but good enough. I bought it on sale and think I got value for what I paid. I would have been disappointment had I of paid full price.	1
1568	Love my echo show!	1
1569	I enjoy this thing. Its learning	1
1570	Am very happy now that i can see.	1
1571	All of my echo devices stopped communicating properly with Sonos devices upon connecting the echo show to my account. Asking any echo device to play music on Sonos baffled the system that had previously worked flawlessly. This went on for two weeks until I eventually solved the problem that neither Amazon nor Sonos could figure out.	0
1572	So far, I like it.  It is better than I expecting it.	1
1573	Doesn't always respond to the wake word. This is my 3rd echo product and I have to say I am A little disappointed. Alexa voice assistant is great when it comes to controlling a connected home but has a lot to learn from google assistant when it comes to  getting answers for search queries.	1
1574	Good product.	1
1575	After two weeks I am not sure if I like the ever present Alexa to have a screen as well.  I bought it to be a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera, and that works.  But the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off - instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video.  There is something about only audio that made Alexa different, no I some ways it is a TV that you can talk to.	1
1576	It f****** sucks	0
1577	 	1
1578	Love being able to read the lyrics of my favorite songs.	1
1579	This thing is awesome for grocery lists, paired with the AnyList app. The flash briefing is very good too. My only complaint is that once you pause something, Alexa decides that you no longer want to listen to that thing. Forever. All in all, definitely worth the purchase.	1
1580	Works great, video call function nice when communicating through drop-in	1
1581	 	1
1582	As you can see Echo Show is in kitchen. It far exceeds my expectation. There‚Äôs a wealth of information about any topic. If is customizable for sound and video. I also have Echo and Echo Dot. You can group them and have hole house music. Still not done exploring all it can do love it. Perfect for getting recipes so you can see them while you‚Äôre preparing to cook.	1
1583	Fairly easy to use	1
1584	Absolutely LOVE my Echo Show!  It is awesome and works great with my Ring Video Spotlight Cams!  Music on demand and so many more features that I have yet to explore!!!	1
1585	Absolutely love it! I use it for everything!I tell my friends and clients that it‚Äôs the daughter I never had. I ask her to do something and she doesn‚Äôt complain! I wish I bought the 2package deal :( I truly needed one in my work room. I kick myself for it.	1
1586	We love having this in our kitchen! Very convenient to look up recipes, listen to the news, or watch prime video while I'm cooking	1
1587	Always wanted one,till I got one, it's not at all what it's cracked up to be, it's hard to navigate I actually like the dot better.	0
1588	The greatest	1
1589	Love it	1
1590	This is my fourth Echo (original and two dots). It's the best.... Decent speaker... Fun graphics...	1
1591	I loved talking it out of the box and being able to easily set up.	1
1592	Easy to setup and use. The ability to play video is huge addition on Alexa device family	1
1593	Echo Show is said to work with certain apps but,NOT!!! Cozi state works with Echo Show, but the Cozi Family‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt very well, Amazon needs to go back to drawing board, it would be such a needed piece of technology, but it lacks the essential, please fix. Cost of the Echo Show was  marvelous . Got Echo Show to take on shopping list but that is all so far, adding items to list has long lag, and it not my router being slow, my provider speed is !GB, speed not a problem, but before new items is updated on Cozi is very slow. Help is needed to get it updated to A1 working conditioning.	0
1594	All the music I can listen too, Also the movie I can watch I can see my ring doorbell .	1
1595	No enough video options	1
1596	Great sound	1
1597	I took advantage of prime Friday and decided to take a chance and purchase one.  I enjoy the features it comes with. I'm sorry I didn't purchase two of them  Well worth the money.  Its looks great on my nightstand.  Every night it puts me to steep with sleeping music.  Happy customer!	1
1598	The music...the shopping list and the sound....	1
1599	diversity, so many things to see and hear. Wealth of information	1
1600	Love it. Thanks Amazon. You guys rock!!	1
1601	Disappointed that this device Is not able to access youtube as of Dec 2017. I wasn‚Äôt aware of that when I purchased it. I‚Äôve had problems with my device. The voice stops working throughout the day. I can see it trying to respond to me, because the window it opens contains the info I asked about, but it‚Äôs like the device gets stuck in the process. It stops working, and the blue bar just flashes. I keep having to unplug and restart the device. Once I do that, it starts working again. So irritating. This device could really be a great device if Google and Amazon would act like grownups...	0
1602	Returned from repair with No repair done. It has a problem which requires it to be on for a while for the defective part to show itself.I sent it for repair and got it back without being fixed.  The site gives no option to complain from the page.I have a echo spot which works perfectly in the same position.	0
1603	Love it!	1
1604	I like the design and the visuals!	1
1605	I haven't had my show very long or used it a lot, but I love it! I use it to set timers when cooking because my stove is being finicky and not wanting to work most of the time. I also use it to check for different recipes, listen to music and my all time favorite.... telling everyone it is time for dinner. My son gets a real kick out of that!I know a lot of people are expecting more out of their shows then it is possible to at the moment, but remember the original echo didn't have what it has now when it first came out. I see that Amazon is adding new stuff all the time and soon I am sure it will have all that we want very soon.... maybe even things we haven't thought of!I do wish it was a bit more user friendly. I still haven't figured out how to video chat with my cousin in North Carolina who also has one, and when I tried to call my son's dot it went to video chat immediately, last I looked, dots don't have video screens!Another thing that needs to be addressed is when my husband tried to have the one in our bedroom play thunderstorm sounds to help him go to sleep, it tried to get him to buy an app instead of playing the skill I had enabled that was free. So now he is a bit worried to use it again. That needs to be fixed.I do have to say that all in all I am very happy with my Echo Show!	1
1606	I have not had it very long. It's my first Alexa thing. I sure like what I have done with it so far there is a lot to learn and play with	1
1607	Works great and has been fun to use.	1
1608	This is the best of my echo devices and I own a spot a dot and echo	1
1609	Having the large screen really majes this an enjoyable experience. Only thing it‚Äôs missing is youtube.	1
1610	easy to use.	1
1611	I bought it to go with my security camera system, but it did not perform like I thought it would. It doesn't alert us when someone is at the door. Also, I can't talk to the person at the door through the echo show, only through my cell phone.	1
1612	Great device, features are awesome, the interaction is fantastic. Home automation works perfect if you link up your accounts correctly. My only issue is out of (4) Echo Shows (2) of them have been sent off for repair because of the screen glitching!! These are less than 3 months old and already having issues!First repairs were sent off and they ‚Äúupdated the firmware‚Äù when I got the device back nothing worked, I had to update to the newest firmware for it to work again. Then (2) weeks later the glitch starts up again!I love the show but I‚Äôm getting really frustrated with the glitching.	0
1613	Super fun !! I ty is what I was expecting	1
1614	 	1
1615	I love this so much!! Alexa is even better when she can show you things!	1
1616	I have the echo but got 2 show. 1 for my Daughter. Absolutely love it. Especially for the video chat.	1
1617	I've had an Alexa Dot for some time but I'm really enjoying the Alexa Show. It's great to have a visual whether it's a song or the weather. Played Jeapordy, but I'm not good at it. You do learn trivia and no one's watching! Love that recipes are visible and movies are available. Haven't had it long enough to try everything.	1
1618	Got this on Amazon prime with the ring pro. Work really great. Being the lazy guy I am I don't need to go see who at my door anymore while I'm gaming.	1
1619	We originally got the Show to video chat family members, and it works great for that. We have found that we really like checking things hands-free like the weather and recipes. So far we have really liked the Show, and would recommend it!	1
1620	Easy setup. Was up and running in minutes. The learning feature is outstanding. Now I know why Amazon is so far ahead of the competition.	1
1621	I bought this product hoping that Alexa would be pretty well developed and far enough along, therefore expecting her to be responsive. This $100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her. (Echo buttons manual, see Step 3.) The device has potential given it has a big screen, decent sound but for 200 bucks, I would never reccomend it. Even for the $100 I spent, I feel like I got shorted. Oh and lastly, the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. I went on the family account (this one) and got it to work minimal. Oh, and even with our prime membership, you have to have a music pass or something that's an extra 3.99 a month, leaving this item a subscription nightmare, and a overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes. I would give it zero stars if I could.	0
1622	quite nice...clear, great sound.	1
1623	Versatile use, can watch movies or news.  Able to use as remote for vehicle.  Or use as a communication hub for the home.  Great produc!!!	1
1624	I bought two.  One for me and one for my daughter who lives in another state.  We love it!!	1
1625	Our family bought several of these to help communicate with older parents and grandparents who need simpler devices than a full-fledged tablet.  What fantastic potential these have - for digital photo screen, video calls, easy accesss to music, audio books, etc. However, once we have them setup, we discovered the huge lurking negative.  Amazon forces you to view continous spam on the home screen promoting all their Alexa features.  You can turn off many other things in settins, but you cannot turn off &#34;Things to Try&#34;.  Instead of a beautiful digital photo screen with weather and time ... we now constantly have a spam ad across the home screen that says, &#34;Try ......&#34;.  AMAZON, please listen to your customers and offer a setting to turn off this SPAM!	0
1626	The best part about owning this is that my mother who is anti-technology uses this with ease everyday and finds new reasons to use it as well. Well done.	1
1627	It‚Äôs my second one, so I put this one in the kitchen for recipes.	1
1628	Echo Show is perfect for staging in the kitchen so recipes are right there. No need to print them. Wonderful device. Acoustical sounds are not as powerful as our tall cylindercal echo but we have that covered in the adjacent family room.	1
1629	Great fun but frustrating at times. Commands between tv and the show get mixed (asking to watch something will turn my directv, not display on show which stinks with an 8 year old) Also would like more video options with flash briefings. Still really a tech wonder for a low price.	1
1630	Love that you can play music and see the lyrics.  Connected to my echo dot I enjoy listening in multiple rooms.	1
1631	I love Alexa and when I had the chance to add Show to my home... I jumped at it.  But... I'm a member and my Show doesn't know I paid for the extras with my Echo (now in the upstairs bedroom.  If I am supposed to pay more for having Show added to my home, then I'm afraid to ask &#34;What's the point?&#34;	1
1632	Purchased as a more &#34;personal&#34; contact vehicle for engaging with long distance grandchildren. Works perfectly in every regard. Resolution and sound both better than expected. Highly recommend.	1
1633	Works well, pictures awesome! Sound could be better. Must be on the same bandwidth as other Alexa devices for whole home music. 2.4ghz vs 5ghz.	1
1634	I am pleased with the Echo Show, from the sound of the music and the words to the tunes to the news and weather. The color on the screen for my photos could be better.	1
1635	Echo Show is my personal assistant! Awesome!!!	1
1636	The packaging was beautiful and then there she was!! We have 2 dots and an echo plus already. Now we have the show and we love it. An echo for each room!You can also say &#34;Alexa, turn off the screen&#34; and it will go black. This is good for sleeping.	1
1637	The ability to respond with the accuracy and variety of information provided by Google search has spoiled me.I had originally expected to see that the same type of search engine in the Echo.Not so, the ability of Alexa to provide such detailed information is not part of the package.Perhaps improvements are in the offing with further updates.	1
1638	My daughter has an Echo Show and she told me how much she loved it. I bought a white one for my kitchen and absolutely love it!  It has all the features of the others plus great extras. The sound system is awesome. I also own the original Echo Tower, Dots and Spot. Each are great and have their uses around my house. I highly recommend all of these products.	1
1639	Really like the show me feature. I also like video calls with others.	1
1640	I love this device.  I bought it simple so that I can have an alarm clock with my Amazon Echo.....and during Prime day for the price you couldn't beat it.  But, I have Sonos and Big Ass Fan lights that I am able to control with this device.  It's perfect and getting better all the time.	1
1641	The ase of participating with Echo	1
1642	I like the weather options but Alexa search compacity needs improvement. She aint no Google. Alexa gets our requests probably around 20% of the time. Currently Alexa doesn't do YouTube either. This is a huge drawback and why The echo show dropped in price.  International radio via tune in is awesome but again her search engine, its like pulling teeth to get to anything.	1
1643	Love it!!	1
1644	LOVE!! i still haven't figured out all the best things we can do with it.	1
1645	Easy to use, Answers all my questions,Hands free, What's not to like , It may not be perfect but it is  a sign of the times to come, can be connected to smart home items, I enjoy it totallly,, Keeps your home connected	1
1646	This product is amazing! I love it!!! Best Buy!!! Only thing missing is Bluetooth	1
1647	It‚Äôs great	1
1648	The Echo Show works great. I enjoy  very much.	1
1649	Works with Blink video cameras.  Does not work with You Tube.	1
1650	I love the simple set up I love the fact that it has all the answers to most of the questions that I have I bought one for everybody in my family so we can all be like the Jetsons	1
1651	The only draw back is it stops every once in awhile in the middle of a song .	1
1652	Great product!	1
1653	Echo is my teacher English, he is very funny,but sometimes he does not listen to what is said.	1
1654	Ight	1
1655	awesome product! I am in the process of having every room in my house set up with automation and The Show is now my favorite device!	1
1656	We‚Äôve had the original Echo for quite some time and just recently added the Show.  It was simple to setup and more inviting to use with the visual interface.  The Echo is being used as the primary interface for my connected home system which is currently only controlling lights and switches.  I look forward to expanding on that capability.  We also use it for maintaining lists, as a music player, general information, and entertainment.  I haven‚Äôt used the Show to shuffle through our favorite  photographs but will start that soon.	1
1657	These things are great!	1
1658	bought two of these. One for my kitchen and the other for my sewing room. Its great if I need a recipe or need to know how to do something.  I am still learning everything it can do.	1
1659	Love how it shows the song info on the screen if playing... also time, notifications, news, etc!	1
1660	Alexa takes some getting used to, but the picture quality is great, the touch screen is very responsive and smooth. Speakers are better than expected as wellFour stars out of five	1
1661	Love it	1
1662	I like the option for white, but it‚Äôs bizarre that it comes with a black cord. I have a white kitchen, so now I have this stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb black power cord. For aesthetic purposes, I was happier with my year-old white Echo (not Show) because it came with a white powercord. This seems like a major design flaw in the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù option. I strongly urge Amazon to change out the powercord to white.	1
1663	I am very pleased with the Echo Show! I love that it has so many nice features. I highly recommend it.	1
1664	The ease of set up and overall functionality makes this Echo show worth every penny.  I especially like setting my background screen and being able to set affirmations that I use as personalized reminders.	1
1665	I love it!  I wanted it primarily for the kitchen.  In addition to other common services I wanted it to use ALLRecipes and Cook's Illustrated recipes	1
1666	Easy to use. Great for recipes, listen to music, see movies, movie trailers, so much to do....	1
1667	I love being able to see information that Alexa gives.  When notifications are turned on it lets you know when your order will be delivered and it also tells you what the order is. You can use the Echo screen to pull up details of your orders. You can use the Alexa skill to make calls from uhyour Echo.	1
1668	Great sound and video!	1
1669	really like it,	1
1670	Love my Echo Show!! Now I can listen to music, get recipes, and so much more!!! I highly recommend the Echo for everyone!!	1
1671	Easy to set up. Plug it in then make some selections for your preferences such as language, temp C or F etc. I am getting more familiar with it and will be adding my calendar and appointments.	1
1672	I like the variety of stuff that the echo show offers.	1
1673	I love it!!!	1
1674	I wish it did more with internet searches.  I do like the feature it has	1
1675	I bought this after visiting a friend who had one and it is great.  I understand the frustration of not having YouTube though.  Still good to have-love seeing the words to songs and if you have the Ring doorbell-you never have to get up from your chair...laziness at it's best!  LOL  All in all- a great product with good speakers.	1
1676	Good smart home gadget.	1
1677	Love the speakers and the screen.	1
1678	No YouTube	0
1679	I loved everything about this item. Quick response time and very sensitive to me speaking from the other end of the house.	1
1680	Bought it for my mother	1
1681	It is great. But it would be better there was a way to use headphones with it.	1
1682	So far so good,  much better sound than my Echo Dot	1
1683	Clear screen and great picture	1
1684	I love it. It is compatible with many of my cameras and it does everything that the echo dot does.	1
1685	I have it in the kitchen. Great for news or music in the a.m. I can video call my daughter and grand kids. I really dig it!	1
1686	I absolutely love this thing. And I love AMAZON because my Echo Show went bonkers and all it took was a brief chat and Voila, a new one to replace it is on the way. I was floored when the screen started blurring and shaking and jumping and missing part of its data. Alexa still talked but I couldn't watch movies. SO HAPPY that Amazon is so easy to deal with and makes good on its products without any hassle at all.	1
1687	Works well for recipes and references. Nice device, just the right size.	1
1688	Works well	1
1689	Works fine, I just realize I don‚Äôt need this because I don‚Äôt use it.	0
1690	It has a screen, microphones, speaker, and alexa lives inside.  Yup it is an Echo Show.  Expectations met.	1
1691	This is very user friendly	1
1692	üëçüèª	1
1693	Let‚Äôs start with.Dislikes: Now I want to buy 7 more to have them all over my house.Do I even need to add my likes now? HahaAwesome fun and useful. Nothing else to say.	1
1694	An outstanding piece of Technology, I use it everyday for information, scheduling and general information.  Awesome Amazon, keep improving with AI.	1
1695	This was an impulse buy and I am super happy I made the purchase. I love this so much I immediately bought my parents one. now we can video chat easily! I love all the features and how easy this is to use and set up.	1
1696	I like it	1
1697	Great product, great price on Prime Day.  Thanks Alexa!	1
1698	Still trying to figure out how to link to Bluetooth speaker.	1
1699	Wish there were more skills	1
1700	Still learning it. We have just started integrating the smart devices in our home with the Echo product line. We now have the Show, the Spot, two Dots and a kids Dot. Having trouble getting them to call each other but still working on it.	1
1701	Great improvement over the original Echo.  Like the ability to see lyrics to songs, watch Prime TV and get other visuals.  The little hints about things to try that appears across the bottom sparks the imagination.	1
1702	Love it!	1
1703	Sound is great,video is great. Now I just need to learn everything it can do. Where can I see videos (youtube), listen to music. watch the news	1
1704	Great addition to our Alexa family. Great video also.	1
1705	If you belong to amazon prime, I would think that you could watch any video on it that was in the library.  You can with prime music	1
1706	Starting my day!	1
1707	Nothing to dislike and it does a lot more than I expected	1
1708	I bought this specifically so my wife could look at our Arlo security cameras from the bedroom when I‚Äôm at work. The system worked for three days and now it just gives me a error message. Very disappointed due to the fact that they advertise that these systems work together. I gave four stars because it does everything else very well.	1
1709	Love it	1
1710	It is awesome. I love being able to turn my lights on so I don‚Äôt have to walk into a dark home. I also get to video chat with my nephews who live states away by just asking Alexa to call.	1
1711	Super easy set up! Great features! FUN!	1
1712	I love the size and the videos are a good quality.  The sound is awesome too.	1

1714	Bought for my older grandparent to help with reminders. Would recommend to anyone with someone in their life with dementia or memory loss. Helps my grandmother remember to take medications and do daily task. She loves it because she can listen to music and ask questions	1
1715	Kids like it for games.  Showing the lyrics for songs is neat.	1
1716	Need to be able to connect to more 3rd party viceo apps	0
1717	Glad I upgraded my aka	1
1718	Still leaning about it. The price was right!	1
1719	I own two dots, a tap and a show. I love the echo show. Sound quality is amazing compared to the dots. I use mine constantly to create shopping list, kitchen and laundry timer, and news updates. But most of all I have the all throughout the house and I play music throughout using the group settings	1
1720	I absolutely love my Show!	1
1721	Echo Show - White&nbsp;Great new addition to our Alexa home solution and now I can call back home and video chat directly from my phone. Great way to stay in touch with family.	1
1722	It's an echo with a screen, hence still needs work. Has me considering google home now.	1
1723	Great product	1
1724	I like the fact that the messages are visual now as well as audible.I am puzzled because it will light up and make the &quot;notification&quot; sound but when I ask Alexa to read my notifications, she tells me that there are no new notifications.  This has happened at least once a day for over a week now.	1
1725	While I loved Alexa....this is a whole new level. Love it. Fun to watch movie trailers. Weather is so much more complete. When you listen to music....the lyrics appear. Still discovering all Echo Show can do. Highly recommend. Takes Alexa to a completely new world.	1
1726	Nice product but as intelligent as we thought or had hoped.	1
1727	The tech isn‚Äôt there. It doesn‚Äôt understand most common words and is basically a glorified radio	0
1728	 	1
1729	Love it!  We have other echoes and love those so I bought this on prime day!  No regrets.  Love that I can connect to my Ring and see the front door.  Yhe kids like seeing the lyrics to songs and sing along. .	1
1730	I love it! Plays great music, movies, and so much more. I does lag when u want to see your arlo security cameras thou. So far so good. Wish it had a longer cord.	1
1731	Love the echo show. The video quality is good and of course sound is good too.	1
1732	Love it. It is in my kitchen so I can watch Prime Video while cooking.	1
1733	Love all of it!!!	1
1734	Great Product	1
1735	We are very pleased with this item. The display is clean and crisp and easy to read. We enjoy trying the suggested things to try asking Alexa. We use the timer feature quite a bit and have added our calendars and contacts. We are still exploring the many skills available.	1
1736	Device has great speakers and the screen quality is phenomenal.	1
1737	We now have a dot, spot, echo and show and love the show and spot best. The show has great sound and my wife loves the display for weather, recipes and sing alongside. Super deal.	1
1738	It doesn‚Äôt play you tube videos	1
1739	Was working great √∫til 1 week algo, √≠ have it for a month, but it started flickering,  and in the support forums they say it is a known isue,  but it has more the 4 months reported and There is no soluci√≥n.	1
1740	We like the video calling feature. We got this so we can be in contact with our elderly parents and it works well	1
1741	The sound on these is terrible. It‚Äôs like a tin can. I love my echo but this item is awful.	0
1742	I have been waiting for the Echo Show to go on sale and it was worth the wait. It was easy to set up and start using	1
1743	Bought this on Prime day	1
1744	This was my 4th echo device, 1st echo show  it seemed to have huge potential, and I really wanted to like it, but soon found out it is quite limited. A bit disappointing, but not the end of the world, I used it like I use my other, screenless echos.... For a little under 2 month, when the screen started flickering, mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just. A quick look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement, as some people had 2-3 devices replaced, only to start flickering again shortly after. Amazon are not providing any serious answers, and this has been going on for quite some time apparently.Long story short, I moved it to the hallway, and been using it as a very expensive... and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights. So like the headline suggests... Meh.	0
1745	Love it to play music works great for finding recipes. Need more family to have adapted machines to see	1
1746	It seems a little less intuitive then the regular Echo Plus. It's also a little harder for it to pick up what you're saying.  When combined with the other four we have in the household, having to speak loud enough for it to hear was cross activating other ones, so we had to rename this one.  Overall it works well, but does not seem as adept at doing things as the original Echo Plus.	1
1747	This is my second Show.  I like them very much.  I use mine for music and my Arlo security cameras.  I can connect and display my outdoor cameras by voice. They are exceptionally capable devices.  I highly recommend them.	1
1748	Love seeing everything in the display!	1
1749	I love this thing.  I enjoy watching the daily news, play music with lyrics (most songs), ordering my coffee..etc	1
1750	We use Alexa primarily for listening to music and checking the weather. We are still learning other ways to use her. Everything has been ready and hands free so far. The speaker has great volume and sound!	1
1751	Plug n Play set up is simple. Added battery base to make it portable. Looking forward to using the hub.	1
1752	Great speaker i n this! I love this so much more than my alexa tap! It‚Äôs definitely fast in response and just so much prettier	1
1753	She's [Alexa] a bit dense and still learning the way I phrase things with my NY/NJ regional accent.	1
1754	Great sound and easy to set up. Purchased the Echo Plus because it had a built in Hub and would make it easier to connect to devices. I am hooked on Alexa!	1
1755	I like the built in hub. Plus the unit sounds great, just wish it had a volume control on it.	1
1756	Happy with Echo Plus. Having fun learning what I can do with it.	1
1757	Love my new Echo Plus	1
1758	Omg we love it!	1
1759	Have had this around a week.. I love that I can control items in my house even if I‚Äôm not there.. makes me feel better about being away from the house and people don‚Äôt know that we are gone.. Alexa has not disappointed!	1
1760	I did not know it needed to be plugged in to work. So far my experiences have been positive.	1
1761	 	1
1762	Was surprised to learn this can be used as a Bluetooth speaker for phones and tablets... it probably lists it in the description, but I missed that part!  It not quite the surround-like quality of a Bluetooth speaker in the $100+ range, but its very good none the less.  And with even basic access to Amazon Music there is a lot to listen to.  There's a huge number of things Alexa can do, learning more every day.	1
1763	It's fun to use... I love novelty gadgets... And Alexa really works well for me...	1
1764	 	0
1765	Awesome device to have in home.  Full of very useful information.  Don't have to us e my phone to answer spur of the moment questions.	1
1766	I like the echo plus it's wonderful the least thing I don't like is it doesn't turn off every	1
1767	We love our Echo Plus. We like listening to music,the sound is great. All the features are nice! I do wish it was wireless so we could listen to music outside!	1
1768	It‚Äôs a great product and easily set up just have to get it in sync with your personal set up	1
1769	Using as a hub and music.	1
1770	Still need more AI built into it to interact better. It needs to continue the conversation sometimes if the finding / answer needs to be right. You can't keep stop Alexa and ask again and again. Also, it should be able to access the wikipedia, dictionary in many areas with better and fast access.Needs to hear us better. Also, we should be able to name it on our own instead calling Alexa or Echo. Price can be reduced a bit (value based) and updates should be auto and daily to improve it.  Connectivity to other home equipment can be imrproved as well.Good product with good sound quality, but needs more AI built in.	1
1771	It was an excellent purchase. Echo Plus has sound quality, good size, I love it... I it!	1
1772	Did take me about 6 hours to set it up I have a Galaxy S9 phone when I got used to the system setup it was in seconds edit my light bulbs adding a string of lights simple easy	1
1773	Great speaker, great microphone response.  Loving my purchase and the beginning of my smart home.	1
1774	This is my 3rd Echo and with the built in hub it works great !  Now I have an Echo in the Family Room, My Bedroom and My Home Office.	1
1775	I don'r know how to use it yet.  Need more explicit directions for the electeonically challenged.  I did not get the feee lifht bulb that was part of the package.	1
1776	Is amazing I have all 3 and I love this	1
1777	Awesome product, very responsive!Alexa just needs more content and variety when it comes to music. It uses the Bing search engine instead of google. If only the two could combine. It would be a perfect product.	1
1778	I am pleasantly surprised at the accuracy of Alexa. The unit is very responsive and can easily respond even with TV or music playing.I did pair two smart  bulbs and they go on, off and dim with ease using voice or app. Fidelity is very good for the size.My only regret is that I would have liked a silver model or a fabric cover but that is an unimportant issue.	1
1779	We went to a Best Buy with the intention of buying Alexa products, instead were talked into the Google Home products. Bought the Google Home and the Home Mini... has trouble from the start setting them up, and they couldn‚Äôt understand my husband (Scottish accent). After days of the ‚Äúoops, something went wrong‚Äù command.. we returned them and bought the Amazon Echo Show and the Echo Plus... so easy to set up! It connected immediately to my amazon account and was way easier to navigate. They both understand commands from my husband on the first try and have yet to give an error message. We have loved these two products and should have gone with what we intended in the first place! You won‚Äôt regret your purchase!	1
1780	Tons of features and skills, and a very good speaker with plenty of bass for music. You still need some work on the AI, in responding to random questions though. My Android phone is far better at those... with the Echo I still get a lot of &#34;hmm, I'm not sure&#34; or &#34;I don't have an opinion on that.&#34;	1
1781	I like Alexa	1
1782	So far it has been fun to use and learn how to deal with Alexa. I am still learning and finding out what can really be done, plus I am in the process of making my house a smart house, so there is no much to control with Alexa yet.	1
1783	I like the whole thing so far	1
1784	Same specs as regular echo, but easier to use than getting a separate hub for smart lights, etc.	1
1785	It's a great product with many good aspects, it easy to setup and control with intuitive straight forward instructions. The included lightbulb was excellent and worked perfectly. I very much enjoy this product and recommend it.	1
1786	Not that much different than the one we had.  Alexa is still stubborn. LOL.  We ordered it on the Prime day to get the light bulbs with it i the deal but did not get the light bulbs.  When we called she said they were sold out.  Felt bad about that.  Now we have to buy light bulbs.	1
1787	To have ability to play Amazon Music outside for patio gatherings. I also used blue tooth to connect Echo Plus via Alexa App on my tablet to an external speaker when/if the party extends into the yard. I have plans to connect other devices such as thermostat and other lighting and home devices.	1
1788	We got this mainly for our son who is currently vision impaired ! it has many good things and setup was fairly easy once I did the first one but they should be easier to setup and come loaded with more stuff ! it should do Text messages to friends easier without them having to download something for it to work and it should link with email and also them common social media like facebook and twitter and others !the whole purpose was to get him back connected to the Web by voice so he wouldn't feel left out and isolated ! they should also have a tech support phone number to call or a way to do direct help to the Echo so tech support can help setup the device ! I had to get a friend whos an IT guy to come help me setup	1
1789	I love every aspect of the Echo Plus, I wanted it for my office. The light was also for my desk lamp.	1
1790	Great hub	1
1791	This is very hard to review because I am part of the  problem.I am 75 and got it so my dog would have distracting noise when I am not home.I am computer literate, iTunes literate, Amazon literate, as well as countless other programs, but am apparently a dunce when it comes to talking to Alexa.  I think I heard her sigh in exasperation.I tried to create a playlist of songs I like only to have it ignored.  I am learning workarounds but they are mediocre, at best...and, as yet do not include a personal playlist.I have scoured the beginners section but the beginners it addresses are far more advanced in basic Alexa than am I.So far, I like what I have been able to use but I'd like it a lot more if I could configure it to my needs, rather than accepting the Amazon/Alexa default.Karen	1
1792	Very satisfied with the purchase. The package came in good time and was just as expected	1
1793	great sound easy set up looks cool	1
1794	Love the Echo Plus!! Much better versatility than the first generation Echo. Intercom and voice-controllable smart bulbs are awesome!	1
1795	My new BFF!	1
1796	Alexa didn‚Äôt know answers to many questions we asked. For example we asked how many cups in a pound and she said a pound is a form of money	0
1797	For now, I love everything. So cool with my music and flash briefings, 5 star Echo	1
1798	Great product. I have two and may want to buy a third!	1
1799	So far we have enjoyed it.  The only problem we have is I have not been able to call one of my sons with it (the sad part is he is the one who gave it to me:( )	1
1800	Love it	1
1801	I have had no problems with my Echo Plus. Would purchase it again.	1
1802	Great	1
1803	I love it.  You own personal secretary.	1
1804	Not perfect but very good! A few times Alexa picked up something from TV, and has a very slight problem with smart home equipment in that she gets confused with what we want to call things. If you call something &#34;light&#34; in the app you need to say light, not &#34;lights.&#34; Echo Plus has no problems as a smart hub but I could use better user directions. Well worth owning and a good step to making my home Smart!	1
1805	Pretty cool. I have only begun to figure out things she does.	1
1806	I have the google home that I really like. The Echo plus I think has even a better sound and am totally happy with it.	1
1807	I love this device. Makes life easier the more you figure out it can do.	1
1808	 	1
1809	"I love my echo plus. I haven't one bad thing to say. It controller music when I need it too. With a great sounding 360 speaker. I also bought a 4k fire TV and it can open Amazon prime video or Netflix at any moment. The included hue lighting makes this product even better. I found myself with a whole array of smart lights perfect for any house or entertainment room. The addition of phone calls on the mic and speaker makes it practical when your busy in the kitchen or on the computer. Alexa will controll it all as soon as you say ""Hey Alexa"". And if the always on mic concerns you well you can always mute the device. This is a must buy for anyone interested in ease and comfort."	1
1810	Amazon Music is great. Love the ability to create my only playlists. Has great sound, not up to the standard of our Bose but very good.	1
1811	Home entertainment.	1
1812	Great product I just wish it had some sort of equalizer... The bass is a little much	1
1813	Its work perfect an I must introduce the rest of the device to complete the functions.	1
1814	I decided to buy smart door lock and decided on getting the Echo Plus to control it.  I chose a Kwikset 888 because Amazon said it was compatible and I bought 2 Dots while I was at it.  And when I posed the question, somebody in the community said it will work with Alexa.  What I didn't know was the Z-wave lock and Zigbee Alexa hub weren't compatible.  Does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with Echo Plus?  If not, I guess my choices are: 1. Exchange the Plus for a regular Echo and buy a separate hub like Wink.  2. Return the whole Alexa system and get something else.I  don't want to just buy another hub to use along side my Echo Plus or I'll be back here asking how to integrate two hubs.The reason I kept from buying smart systems up to this point  is because I was afraid they wouldn't operate seamlessly and unfortunately I only do enough research after something doesn't work.	0
1815	This Echo Plus has proved to be the most innovative improvement in my life!	1
1816	I purchased the Amazon Echo Plus on Amazon prime day because I need a hub. I'm in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home. For the same price as some hub's, and even less expensive in some other cases. I got a hub that works with my devices, plus it does a lot more. I haven't even had time to go through all the skills it has, but I've already found myself using many of them. When I started a search for a hub. I wasn't even considering the Echo. In part, because I didn't know it was a hub. But also because I didn't really think I would find much use for another AI system. If you're looking for a hub. Why settle for a plane hub, when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet cost's the same or less than other hubs? Oh! And by the way. For the same price as the Amazon Echo Plus alone. I found one that came bundled with a smart bulb & saw another that came with a smart plug. Given the price of these extras. Well, that just put the Echo Plus over the top.	1
1817	I'm so happy that I purchased Alexa.  When I recently saw this at a friend's home, he played some music while talking about the product.  I love the sound & love that all I have to do is tell Alexa or ask a question & she responds immediately.  I haven't been able to listen to my CD's for a while since I have a problem within my stereo equipment for some time now so this makes me extremely happy that it's not an issue any longer.	1
1818	After we learned to use this (we are still learning), we are very pleased with Echo Plus	1
1819	I Love it !! Used one like this in Philly while visiting my son and decided to buy my own on Prime Day !	1
1820	The speakers on these devices are surprisingly good. The functionality of each echo device is fantastic.	1
1821	As advertised.  Connected my smart bulbs with no problems.	1
1822	It works perfect!	1
1823	Love warehouse buys. If this was just in good used condition, then new must be newer than new. Seriously, this one was perfect, not a mark on it anywhere. Great buy!	1
1824	Alexa is awesome! The first day I got my Echo Plus I found out things that she can do that I didn‚Äôt think were even possible. I highly recommend this product. Along with all the accessories.	1
1825	Ease of set up. I‚Äôll have fun sitting up other features as well as making my house a smart home.	1
1826	I try use with yale lock but isn‚Äôt work	1
1827	IT SEEMS TO BE OK BUT THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE WEAK AND I CAN NOT SEEM TO GET IT TO WORK. I AM GOING TO GET MY TECHY FRIEND TO HELP ME OUT AND I WILL UPDATE YOU LATER	1
1828	I love everything about it. I love that the echo plus turns on and off my light. It can also dim them with voice commands. I also like listening to my kindle books even the ones that I didn‚Äôt purchased  audibles for. I like that it can play my music from Amazon music, pandora, tunein, I heart radio and Spotify. Echo can even play my local radio station. I love that the echo is connected to my TiVo Bolt. This allows TiVo to pause, stop and play whatever I want with a simple voice command. I love that I can reorder items that I purchased on Amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed, when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered.  The only three dislikes that I have is that if you‚Äôre up too close or to far the echo doesn‚Äôt respond. So I think they need to improve the microphone. And I wish the speaker was better. The speakers are okay but could be improved. Also I have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet. Well the other day I received a Red Light Right on my Echo Plus. This error was Sorry I‚Äôm having trouble understanding you please try again later. After research online I learned it was a problem connecting to my internet. And it was easy to find this out. And I found it odd that my dot wasn‚Äôt having this problem even though they are connected to the same network.	1
1829	Love everything about this....	1
1830	Perfect for controlling my tp-link smart devises	1
1831	Love this thing. Easy to setup and  looking forward to adding more smart devices to my home.	1
1832	Got it specifically to work with the August Smart Lock and it connected to it with ease.  Definitely ties the Smart Home together.	1
1833	Sound very nice perfect for the price	1
1834	Love it it's number 4!	1
1835	Wonderful product.  Love alexia	1
1836	It has a nice speaker.	1
1837	Music mainly but still checking other features	1
1838	Very capable.  Language recognition is the best I've experienced.  Great sound, too!	1
1839	LOVE .. LOVE my Echo Plus !  So silly simple to set up .  Alexa has now become my new BFF.  Amazon 24/7 Support is hard to beat !!  Any questions answered any time ... What more can you ask for !!!	1
1840	Its got to be one of the coolest things.	1
1841	Awesome! Easy set up. Linked right up with my Nexia home automation.	1
1842	Hands free voice commands and interactions with smart devices around the house makes having an Echo Plus one of the best purchases I‚Äôve made!	1
1843	Definitely a really good buy for FIRST time buyers of smart home stuff =]I bought 3 =]	1
1844	I enjoy the various functions of the device	1
1845	Alread had Echos and Dots, but the ability to control Philips Hue bulbs nudged me to buy this on Prime Day.  Another fun product from Amazon.	1
1846	I purchased the Echo Plus with the Build-in Hub, so I could have the convenience of asking Alexa to turn my lights and lamps on and off.  Philips Hue Light Bulbs were placed in the fixtures that I wanted Alexa to control and they all work great!  I already had an Echo Dot in my Kitchen/Den area, so I placed the Echo Plus with Hub in my bedroom. My radio and lamps in my Kitchen and Den are controlled with TP-Link plugs.  But, the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my Den and Bedroom have special Philips Hue Light Bulbs that are controlled by the Hub inside the Echo Plus.  I am able to play music, set my alarm, get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices.  The Echo Dot requires a TP-Link plug to be plugged into it and the Echo Plus requires a special Philips Light Bulbs installed in each light fixture to work..  The only thing I dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work. Regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures will not work with Alexa and  the Echo Plus with Hub.  Other than the high price of the bulbs, I love my Echo Plus with built in hub!	1
1847	Easily configured hub capabilities.  Excellent sound quality for the size of the unit.	1
1848	Works great in my large open room	1
1849	Fun	1
1850	This is outstanding works awesome the music sound very clear and loud and Alexa is very smart	1
1851	I bought this specifically for the smart hub capability. So far it has been great. Easy set up instructions for all the various brands compatible with it.	1
1852	The sound is wonderful and it just plain works. I wish it cost less, but it is worth the cost. (especially on Prime Day)	1
1853	Comes with a hub.  Got it during prime day for $99 and a hue white bulb.  Works great.  Now I can add more stuff that required a hub!	1
1854	Got it for the smart hub and does exactly was it says, turn lights on and off, arm and disarm my security system and the thermostat is next.  Great.product!	1
1855	Very easy to set up, great sound.	1
1856	So far it's been very useful. Trying to learn all the ways to use Alexa .	1
1857	works better than I thought	1
1858	Loved all about it, all I can do with it and it looks good.	1
1859	Great product and fast shipping. Thank you	1
1860	It's fun to imagine the household management options ...Some info questions baffle Alexa, but other options are cool - esp. music-related ...	1
1861	Easy to set up and works like it's supposed to.	1
1862	Love it, very easy to set up.love that you can request just about anything on your mind and it works on giving you useful information.	1
1863	Great product. More skills are needed. I love it.	1
1864	My first smart buy..I am loving it and all the great things Alexa can do.	1
1865	This thing is awesome!  I got it on Prime Day for a great deal.  I wish I had purchased two.  I also bought the Echo Show version, but the sound is not nearly as good as the Echo Plus.  The Echo Show came dented, so I will be exchanging it.  I like the screen and many of the features so I will not be getting a refund.  It was still worth the price.	1
1866	Is great having a new friend	1
1867	Coop product many uses including smart devices throughout the home	1
1868	Easy setup with great sound, I would rate this unit a 10 +++++, and a must have for the office and home. l am looking add other devices (locks, and lights) for my home.	1
1869	Better than expected!	1
1870	Wonderful, still learning how to use. Had a heck of a time setting it up, but is happened somehow.	1
1871	It's fantastic. Very happy with the purchase.	1
1872	Love it!!!	1
1873	I like the list ability and the music I can play.  I do not like that I can not create a playlist without using the app and even then Alexa will not play my songs I have to do it through my tablet or phone.  I also do not like that Alex can not print again it has to be done through the app.	1
1874	It is a great bundle of fun. Music ,games, questions etc. I luv it turns off my smart lights. I purchase 4 more smart light for my lamps in the living room and my room!	1
1875	First time using Alexa and so far I love it.	1
1876	It was a little hard to follow their instructions, great product	1
1877	This was a replacement. It was really easy to set up. I had to reauthorize my smart items to work with the new hub, but installation was easy and instructions were clear.	1
1878	Really cool device that does a ton of stuff. Fun games like Jeopardy. We used this to set up smart bulbs and light switches. Make sure you ge the stuff that corresponds with this particular hub. Had to make a few runs back to the store for exchanges.	1
1879	I‚Äôve been waiting for Prime Day to purchase an Echo Plus and now, I‚Äôm enjoying learning what Alexa can do. With a new Sonos One and an Echo Dot, I have the makings of a really nice and well-integrated smart home. Love it!	1
1880	I haven't had it very long, but so far our whole family is enjoying asking Alexa questions!	1
1881	Although this is my second echo device, I am still very disappointed that there is almost no documentation/instructions as to the many functions of the device.  I purchased becausse of the sound quality, but only found out it has bluetooth capabilities last night by accident.  There needs to be a manual that details all of the functionality of the device.  Or at least point out where it can be found...	1
1882	The Echoplus is a great extension for the Echo Dots in our home. I am a little disappointed that Alexa is not as good at information requests as Google. But as a start on home automation, she is very impressive.	1
1883	I never had ALEXA before but the biggest reason I bought it was for YOUTUBE and apparently YOUTUBE stopped supporting it and that is why it will get 4 stars.... it's mostly YOUTUBE's FAULT but I worked around it by using my cell phone as a blue tooth connected to hear things but still takes the voice activate purpose away but the speaker is amazing to hear my youtube watch later playlist	1
1884	Awesome!! Loving Alexa	1
1885	no habla espanol	0
1886	Love the music the stories	1
1887	It is fantastic.	1
1888	Like it but it will take time to setup all the skills I want simply because there are so many. I already use music and Flash Briefing daily. Very satisfied. I use this along with Alexa app on my Kindle hd8	1
1889	Wish it would have came with the lightbulb, but otherwise works great, fast delivery, and I enjoy using it!	1
1890	Still haven‚Äôt learn all the Echo can do, but so far, quite pleased!	1
1891	Love it!	1
1892	I can receive my CPR classical station.  Great sound.What I like least is the learning curve and my mistakes.	1
1893	Sounds well and we find it useful overall but it can be frustrating when it doesn‚Äôt respond or you forget the correct command.  ‚ÄúAlexa, turn on the living room lights‚Äù.  Oops I mean ‚ÄúAlexa turn on the family room lights‚Äù. I also never realized I call my couch a sofa some times.  Unfortunately my Alexa is confused by my changing names for where I sit.	1
1894	no it is broke and I can't get help fixing or replacing it	0
1895	I‚Äôm still unable to connect any devices although it says it has a built in hub. So bought a bridge to connect the devices thinking that everything would sync and my other devices are still not discovered via my echo plus and I was looking forward to this feature. Being able to play music, check the weather etc is fine.	0
1896	sounds great have not used the hub yet	1
1897	Is as expected and more, responds very fast to given commands and was very easy to connect via the Amazon App. I also bought the PhilipsHue Light Bulb and all I had to do was put it in my lamp and tell Alexa to find my device and it connected and the lamp now turns on and off with voice commands.	1
1898	Sound is better	1
1899	It is as if we are having a conversation with another person.  Instantaneous response.  And the fact that it catches your command even when you're far from it is simply just amazing.	1
1900	Although I haven't taken advantage of many of the Echo's features there is one that bothers me. It starts talking even when I haven't said anything even close to the wake up word - ECHO - had to change from Alexa due to a conflict with another device.	1
1901	The echo plus is very straight forward and easy to use.  It plays great sounding music and can do lots of other things.  Still learning what all it can do.  Working very well so far.	1
1902	We have used for last 2 weeks. We like it. My children also like it. Alexa has become part of our family.	1
1903	Terrible. Stopped working after one day.	0
1904	better sound than my echo dot. Simple to set up, less than 5 minutes.	1
1905	Nice toy to have around!	1
1906	It does not speak in Spanish,,,I bought it for my grandmother to have someone to talk to when I‚Äôm not around,,,,,no Spanish!	0
1907	Love all the cool thing I can do!	1
1908	Great product	1
1909	Like it. Still working discovery. Really too soon to fully evaluate. But looking forward to learning and using it.	1
1910	When I got this Echo I was excited to have a device with better sound than my Dot and a hub to control some Hue bulbs.What I didn't realize and also wasn't fully communicated to me, is that you can't use Hue bulbs to their full potential with this device. You can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors. You also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me.Do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new IoT devices. If you do, you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub, which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointless.I still love the echo and have zero complaints about the Alexa functionality or sound quality of this device. I'm only disappointed with the hub's functionalities.	0
1911	Still needs some work on commands. Sound is equal in the regular echo so if you don't need a smart hub get a regular echo. The sound is ok with it had as much bass as my old soundlink but I mean hey gets loud on the treble and sounds clear.	1
1912	I love my echo plus. I use it with my Spotify account, to find my phone, make phone calls,  turn our lights off and on, much more. Most importantly it reads story to my children.  They love it and that makes me happy.	1
1913	Excellent why didn‚Äôt I think it is in the beginning I love it	1
1914	Bye bye Philips hub and expensive monthly internet charge!  Took a little tinkering, had to rest the individual bulbs, but works great! No more, &#34;Philips hue bridge is not responding&#34; message.	1
1915	Works great! Exactly as described. Only complaint I have is sometimes Alexa gets confused with smart home product names and i had to go back and change some stuff around, but i chalk that up to my inexperience with smart home stuff.	1
1916	I love it. Use it mostly for the music huge repertoire to choose from	1
1917	Very easy to hook up. Download the app and it walks you through the setup	1
1918	I am so disappointed in this product.  I tried to install two different units and neither one of them were successfully completed.  Hours with Amazon technicians.. resetting each of them.  The app didn't connect the Echo Plus to the internet connection.  Tried using the application on a phone, a tablet and on a Chromebook... No luck.  There are no clean directions on the application.  Probably sending this back to Amazon..mark this as Not ready for prime time.	0
1919	Well behaved device that i enjoy using.	1
1920	Easy setup and sound quality.	1
1921	I really love the hub feature	1
1922	What a blast!  We love Echo...  Just learning all the tricks but lots of fun and helpful too!	1
1923	Love this!	1
1924	Great sound quality, works well with smart home devices	1
1925	Use way more often than we used our Google Home.	1
1926	Mic hears everything but only understands about half the first time, it often takes multiple tries until it gives the correct result.	1
1927	Nice add on to a home.What I don't like are the limitations, for example world soccer. It won't give you much info of sport teams other than American.	1
1928	I was a little apprehensive about buying this because I saw reviews saying it sounds like crap. I'm no audiophile by any means so maybe it's that, but I think it sounds great considering the size. It fills my living room with sound and gets pretty loud while remaining clear. I haven't had any issues pairing with my devices or utilizing any of the voice commands. I have it paired to an EcoBee3, my Firestick, and a Phillip's Hue light bulb. I plan on adding devices as I go. I love this thing and I'm glad I scooped it up! I have only had it around 2 weeks. Will update if I run into issues.	1
1929	I love my Echo Plus. The only drawback is that there is no battery so it has to be plugged in at all times which makes it inconvenient  to use outdoors.	1
1930	Great device, my grandkids had a ball setting it up for me!	1
1931	The alexa is awesome but when i rcieved the light buld i did not know that u need another adapter to have the light buld to work. I was not aware of that.  Disappointed	0
1932	The Echo Plus is great! So easy to set up and with the built in hub, it connects to other Alexa devices with a mere verbal command. I am 62 and not super techno knowledgable but this was easy for me. Have my lights integrated with Alexa and now looking at security cameras and locks. Definitely recommend the Echo Plus!	1
1933	Works as advertised! It says Alexa is always learning. That's great because I am just learning all the things Alexa can do.	1
1934	Great , love it.	1
1935	wish it had a battery or was described better as a plug in only item.	0
1936	Doesn't seem to hear as well as my 2nd Generation Echo and WHY is there no volume buttons on it?!	1
1937	A+	1
1938	Worked great. The built in hub works great.	1
1939	It knows everything  we ask it to do. Havent smart hubbed it yet but does exactly as advertised and am very happy with our purchase. Sound quality is excellent also	1
1940	Connecting and sound are perfect! I only give 4 because the is no internal battery, if I disconnect to the power source, it will be off.	1
1941	It seems easy to stump Alexa with rather simple questions that are easily googled with the correct answer.  We admit that we have not explored all that's available through the Echo.  One irritating issue is that Alexa cannot answer help questions concerning how to use the system, rather it refers you to the Alexa app or help via a computer.  It was very simple to setup and use and we continue to learn how this tool can become more useful.	1
1942	I like how easy it was to set up. Very easy to use and set up with other Bluetooth devices.	1
1943	Ease of use and many tasks it will perform	1
1944	I purchased the Echo Plus with built-in hub during Prime Days sale. It was delivered very fast and was easy to link to my WiFi. Also connected it to a smart plug to control a light. I love telling Alexa to play music, and she hears me from 2 rooms away. Excited to learn new uses for it.	1
1945	It was harder to setup then I thought it should be, for some reason I had to default  it twice. Had to go thru too many steps to setup and find my devices. Would be nice if it could interact with my Xfinity cable tv cable box and it also does not work with my Xfinity alarm for my house or my cameras, be nice set and disarm the alarm with Alexa. Had to install a skill app to setup bulb ??? whats that about, you ship it with your product ??? should have said (Alexa setup bulb) or (Alexa find new bulb) ??? and (Alexa setup Nest)??? it's fine that you use third party apps but Alexa should do the work for you.	0
1946	Nothing to dislike I love my new toy that has made my house a smart home.	1
1947	The built in hub lacks some of the features (geo fencing) of the Phillips hub.  Otherwise would have given it 5 stars.	1
1948	The Echo Plus is used for leisure and pleasure. I absolutely love it. Easy to set up and connect. What a great addition to my listening pleasure. I have not used it yet for other purposes.	1
1949	Arrived right on time and works as expected	1
1950	It's like a remedial form of the Star Trek computer in your home	1
1951	The echo part works fine.  The hue hub is a disaster.  It worked for a few months and then nothing.  I spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support one =y to have to send it in for repair.  I am now trying to reconnect my lights.  What a pain.  I am having to reset each light bulb.  It can take up to 5 times to get it to reset.  I have spent hours on this.  I will say customer service was friendly and tried to be helpful.  Stick with the echo and smart plugs for lamps.	0
1952	I love it and my family loves it also we use it all the time we also like playing the games that you can get on it too!! Great for family game nights	1
1953	It was supposed to come with a free Hue lightbulb on Amazon Prime Day.  No light bulb arrived.  False advertising!	0
1954	 	1
1955	Awesome!	1
1956	Haven't had it a week and already it cannot connect to my network. Tried reconnecting manually and the echo never appears in the list of devices to connect. It will be on it's way back to Amazon	0
1957	This is the 3rd unit I purchased all the way from gen 1 to the plus. The only reason I purchased this is because it works so well and I wanted it in other rooms as well. All my switches work great and I have had not issues. I the past, I did have some ghost commands when Alexa would answer a question when no one asked her to but I think some recent ipdates May have resolved this. It just keeps improving over time, not with call capabilities. I work with adapting smart homes and this is by far the cheapest, best way so far. Can‚Äôt wait to see what they come up with next.	1
1958	Love it. I play music everyday and voice  activated makes it so easy	1
1959	I can't get multiple profiles working. It just spins when adding a 2nd user at pass device prompt	1
1960	I love it , using music and turning on and off light	1
1961	It has great sound and very responsive to commands!	1
1962	This thing is great. Has good sound and does everything I expected. I have it linked in with my lights and use it with alarm.com as well.	1
1963	No problems whatsoever makes life easy and sounds great.	1
1964	This is a very useful device.  I use it to turn my lights on and off around the house.  It works with all the other Alexa devices, so I can give a command near any of them, and this will process the request.  It also handles all the functions that the other devices can do. I enjoy it much more than I thought I would.	1
1965	I love my echo plus!!!	1
1966	How can you not like the Echo Plus.  It has the built in Hub and works seamlessly with all my compatible devices.  Amazon makes a great product and I haven't had a single issue with this one or any of the other devices (echo dots, etc.).	1
1967	I have been hesitant to purchase anything smart home because I am just not good with electronics.  However this surprised me how easy it is to set up and it links to the Bluetooth in my sound bar for my TV which provides extra sound for music, I can make calls and finally hear people when home. I do not have cable, only the paid apps like Netflix and Hulu so when Alexa provided me news stations, weather and other updates it was really great to hear! I have linked all of my accounts to her, she turns on my lights before I walk through the door. She purchases re-orders off of Amazon for my pets and I heard if something bad happened at your home she would place a call to 911 regardless if she was unplugged or not.  This is important as an extra layer of protection for someone living alone.  My tech savvy bf went out and bought her after a week of me having her. Must buy!!!	1
1968	I love my Echo Plus and have cousins from Italy here visiting and they love it.  I want to give them each one, however will it work for them in Italy. someone please answer my question ASAP.	1
1969	Totally enjoy our new Echo Plus.  Great for fast facts and listening to Beautiful Music.  We are just getting started with all the benefits.	1
1970	Device is touted as able to link to calendar on my Samsung phone through google, can't get it to work	1
1971	Love this product!!	1
1972	Music. News. Shopping list. Jokes. Games	1
1973	Works well. Need to speak clearly but picks up commands from a good distance and the sound is surprisingly well.	1
1974	I'll be returning it.  It's been nothing but annoying.  The hub can't be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my Hue Bridge.  I can't even install Philips lights with it unless I unplug it to do so.  There are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues.  Bottom line is it sucks as a hub.  It doesn't support z-wave and zigbee (which in fairness I knew in advance), but when the one protocol it does support doesn't do many functions that a dedicated one will, what's the point?  I noticed right away that my Philips Hue Bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this doesn't.  I found that rather interesting.	0
1975	 	1
1976	The Echo does not link to Direct tv even though they said it would. I have spent multiple hours on this. Made phone calls and texts. Also is missing free bulb.	0
1977	Still learning what it can do. Amazing. Simple, works right out of a box. Only frustration is getting Amazon Alexa app t show up on my Samsung/Galaxy with Google's Android.	1
1978	well what can you say,  Love It  Love It  Love It  enough said	1
1979	Doesn't use apple music.  It is worthless to me without it.  Sound quality on it is also poor.	0
1980	Great product, easy to install and use! Not a necessity but a commodity!	1
1981	 	1
1982	Works great I bought this Direct from amazon, and I have got to tell you, This item Echo Show and Echo Plus is the best item I have ever had and I am kind of a tech geek. I am a disabled person, and it helps me turn light on and off, and schedule doctor appointments, using google voice phone, and get my medical rides to and from hospitals, plays music on cue from multiple web apps, and watch videos, as well as communicating to my Nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events. I wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights. They are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them. Although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the Echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off. Thank God, no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights. Thank you Amazon. I will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from Affirm.com to purchase 1 more of each and some lights for rest of the house. Jeff Bezos these are awesome items and because of your allowing me to get amazon prime at a lower cost due to disability I was finally able to buy these items on your prime day event. really helped when all you earn a month is $672 on SSDI thank you all again.	1
1983	I'm sure the Echo is as cool as everyone says....but I won't get to try this one. Even though I have a Large covered porch.....the package was left on my top step on a day forecast for 100% chance of rain.....and rain it did, soaking the package. I'm not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is. This order has been cursed from the beginning. Ordered as a Birthday Gift and Delivery was not made on scheduled day. Now I get it, and its rain-soaked.	0
1984	So far I love it.  It was easy to set up - if I can do it anybody can.  Speakers are great and its fun to play my music with just a voice command!	1
1985	I am not tec smart enough to make it work at all. Will send it back if I cant get help. My eco dot works just fine. this is too complacated.I just wanted a bigger speaker.	0
1986	We are a long time Amazon Prime family, many years, but new to the Alexa world and thought the purchase of Alexa Plus, with hub, and included Phillips Hue light bulb would be a great start. Alexa does a lot of good things for us like Alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, but not Bose. But, the ads say &#34;Hub included&#34; so don't need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device  support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. The list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge. Was very disappointed to find that out after the fact, to the point I feel we are being misled by Amazon by included the Hue bulbs without explanation. Maybe throw a good discount my way to get the Hue bridge if I keep the Echo Plus before I invest in more light bulbs.	1
1987	 	1
1988	I love it but does not play well with my Amazon Prime... many shortcomings and potential fees	1
1989	Item as described and delivered on time.  Thank you	1
1990	I bought 2 of these (plus 2 Echo Dot 2nd Generation) on Prime Days. Love the Echo Plus easy to setup. The reason for the 4 star is the fact that one of them did not arrive with the free Philips Hue White A19 Single LED Bulb Works with Amazon Alexa. There is no one to call to find out why.	1
1991	Product does not.  Light bar never went orange.  I googled it and reset instructions actually differ from package instructions. I tried both.  Product is defective	0
1992	Exactly what I wanted with speedy shipping.....thank you so much!	1
1993	Easy to install	1
1994	I have an original Echo and really like it. I wanted another one for my basement. I realize it isn't a huge stereo with settings but it doesn't sound bad at all. Definitely doesn't take up much room. Great price for the Echo Plus on Prime Day. I ordered two!!	1
1995	I bought this on prime day and saved lots.I have 3 large blue tooth speakers in my house that I used for years, the echo plus was louder than all 3 combined at the same time. Very impressed with the clarity and volume.You will need a paid subscription to some form of steaming audio. That‚Äôs just a sad fact. It‚Äôll play pandora and Spotify but it‚Äôs limited in skips and song selection without a subscriptionDoes not stream YouTube music or YouTube audioApple users will be disappointed to see that it‚Äôs not as convenient as an apple deviceOverall, I still loved the device but I‚Äôll be getting the DOT which has an audio out jack (as does the echo plus) and just connect to external speakers	1
1996	I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb.  The excited ended quickly.  I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus.  Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message.  I tried to set this up over and over and over again.  I watched YouTube videos.  I read set up websites.  I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support.  I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work.  This product has tested my patience.  So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb.  The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo?  The support person had the same thought.  Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub.  It looks like a defuser.I can't believe I didn't find YouTube videos that show the problems I did.  Everything looked simple and seamless...NOT the experience I had.  OK, I'm done with this review because I spend enough wasted time this weekend already.	0
1997	Got this in a pretty good deal during the prime day event. It sounds pretty good and works well so far.	1
1998	very nice and its does not take up space	1
1999	I'm an original purchaser of the Echo when they came out with a limited few in their test phase and I've always loved it. I expanded my Alexa usage by adding a few Echo Dots around the house and finally decided to jump and buy an Echo Plus. Let me tell you what, GREAT choice! As much as I love my original Echo, the Plus was an obvious upgrade immediately noticeable. The sound is great. And the fact that it's got a built in hub for the Philips Hue lights is a huge plus!	1
2000	received the wrong product...was so excited to install it ...all excitement gone. Thank you Amazon.	0
2001	I‚Äôm having trouble with it, the alarm most of times doesn‚Äôt work, the timer doesn‚Äôt ends... and Alexa keeps saying she is unavailable.	1
2002	Love it just wish I could play my amazon music on both my devices without having to buy an additional subscription	1
2003	Sounds a little better than the original plus it now has an interrogated Zigbee hub.  The hub is compatible with the GE Link bulbs.	1
2004	I got it to try side by side with the Echo originale. They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don't really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don't think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs. Net net for me, this Echo does not do anything more than the original Echo and sound quality is not as good. With the  original Echo available as refurbished I would check that out first before considering this or the new Echo which is clearly inferior to both of these.	1
2005	Why do we need to buy a $100 hub to get it to work with Samsung TV's and many other devices?  I want my money back!  This thing won't even turn on my TV unless I buy another hub.  What's the point of having a hub that doesn't support half the devices out there?  DON'T buy this thing unless you want to spend another $100 on another hub.  It won't work with many of your devices.  Just by the Echo or Dot if you must but not this.  Better yet, get a Google device.  They actually understand you when you talk.	0
2006	I love it, in my living room	1
2007	Absolutely love it..  only thing that would make it better is if was rechargeable.  When playing  music with  Bluetooth speaker outside I have to go inside to change songs.	1
2008	I only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb.  When I got everything set up, I realized the echo plus hub won‚Äôt allow full functionality of the bulb.  All it does is turn the light on/off and dim.  It will not change colors.  You still have to have a Hue Bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb.  I wish I‚Äôd bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo I already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and I‚Äôll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights.	0
2009	At a volume setting of half or less, the speaker sounds like there is something rattling, crackling or vibrating in it.  I'd understand if the volume was set higher.  All speakers get distorted when over-driven.  But this doesn't sound like this is an over-driven case; sounds like more of a rattle/crackle.  Possibly because the bass is too high.  Learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics (other than volume).  I will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem.	0
2010	the Sound is fantastic for the Classic  music. is like you have the orchestra at your home. and you can control the sound with out screamig at it you just have to twist the top, but also you can tell  &#34;Alexa volume 3&#34;	1
2011	love Alexa, makes it fun when people are around and seeing it for first time	1
2012	I was suppose to get the ‚Äúfree‚Äù lightbulb with purchase. It did not come with Echo. Upon reading more carefully, it says to click a box to receive free bulb. üò≥ of course I want the free bulb, who wouldn‚Äôt? Just a sneaky way for them to get out of having to give so many ‚Äú free‚Äù  bulbs away. Disappointed!  I have yet to set up my echo, our first purchase on any alexia device. Debating if we want to keep it. It did come quickly with my prime membership.	1
2013	I bought this for myself and i didn‚Äôt realize it had to be plugged in just to work. It isn‚Äôt convenient to make them always have to connect to a wall. It should‚Äôve been more clear when i bought it.	0
2014	 	1
2015	Alexa helps with more than just lights or music, it helps out when your kids think they know everything and you know nothing  lol  Sweet  love it  so much so I purchased 2, Alexa has been a great purchase for my uncle whom lives by himself, when I got it he wasnt so keen on it, but now its his best friend, he tells her goodmorning and she will say it back along with a description on something that is happening today or something special that happened years ago on that day, as well as sang him Happy birthday  lolol  he now has educated him self on things he never knew, and laughs at the things she may say when he waits to see he response to something hes asked  love it, and to think I was going to hate it.	1
2016	Incredible piece of technology.I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now.	1
2017	Easy to Install. Very clear speaker. I took one star off because it was delivered late by OnTrac-like usual.	1
2018	Love, Love, Love	1

2020	Good product.	1
2021	I would like to tell you that I have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck, or the color, or the shape or even the way it smells, but I can honestly say the number reason I hate this device is I have tried to set it up 3x's now to no avail, I have 4 other Echo devices already that I set up and use quite regularly, I have reset my phone (Galaxy S8), checked the app for updates, I have cycled power to the Echo unit with each attempt. I work in the network/technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. I used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and I have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the Echo and try again. I figured 3x's was enough, it shouldn't be that hard a techie, I can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology....I hope they won't call me I'll tell em to send the product back!	0
2022	Pretty cool device. Still have a lot to learn, but I'm changing channels on my Fios, and getting info needed. the speaker is great for what I needed it for, which mainly is music.	1
2023	Unit came with the wrong plug, will have to send back to Amazon.	0
2024	Love It	1
2025	The sound quality is really quite good. I also have a Dot which is Bluetooth linked to a Grace Digital amplifier which is driving a couple of floor standing Snell speakers, obvious the floor standing speakers are better than this but not by much. My only complaint is that you can't customize Alexa hot words. Now that I have multiple Alexa devices there needs to be a way to direct an Alexa command to a particular device. I would like to be able to talk to a device by name.	1
2026	Love the light bulb feature	1
2027	The Echo Plus works as expected but I never received the Philips Hue smart bulb that was supposed to be included as part of my purchase. Please advise.	1
2028	very nice! everything is working fine. just have to 100% learn the commands	1
2029	The sound quality is great, it now replace the echo dot in my kitchen.	1
2030	Just got mine last night. Played around with it for a while. Should have bought it a long time ago.	1
2031	So easy to use, non-stop music!	1
2032	 	1
2033	Great product and Prime Day price! Took a while to figure out how to connect to my wireless network and the other Echo devices in my home. This came with a Philips smart bulb. It's better than having a clapper! I found instructions online to 'wake to music & philips light'. Very easy to set it up with the instructions. You even have an option of what song you want to wake up to!	1
2034	Exchange new color	1
2035	Alexa is the best smart speaker out there I'm so glad I came across it the sound is so amazing and I mostly use Amazon Alexa for music and school work help I love to control my room lights and the color totally recommend	1
2036	It get on sale after 2 days so ... CHECK EVENTS BEFORE U BUY THESE AMAZON PRODUCTS!	1
2037	 	1
2038	Pros- plenty loud for a large room with high ceilings.Cons - the hub doesn‚Äôt do anything.  It doesn‚Äôt work with z wave (as it states), it doesn‚Äôt take voice commands for SmartThings, which I had to buy since the hub doesn‚Äôt work for z wave.It also sounds muffled and there is no way to control the EQ. (Not sure if that is on all models, but the Dots we have are clear.For the money, buy an echo dot or echo (2nd generation).  The echo dot takes voice commands for the smart things hub, go figure, and the audio is clear. The dot also seems to hear my voice better and almost at a whisper.	1
2039	Alexa is a decent speaker if that's all you need. She is terrible at most other things. She consistently answers questions that were not asked or says &#34;hmmm I don't know that&#34; for everything else. We've gone back to just using our phones because she can't really look anything up. Pretty much everyone makes fun of me for spending money on this when I had an awesome Bose bluetooth already. I bought her because my mother (who lives alone) uses hers a lot and is happy with it, but we have a full house with kids and I'm less than impressed. I'd never recommend it to anyone except for senior citizens who love alone and need to be able to shout out for help in the event of a fall.	1
2040	The setup of this device was simple and effective.  I am very pleased to see all of the additional skills and add on abilities of Alexa.  This is great for my mobility issues.  I now have the ability to have my shopping and comfort needs met without depending on friends and family.	1
2041	Perfect!!!	1
2042	We love it! Bought the light bulbs as well and we use it daily!	1
2043	Alexa is great only she will laugh or add random comments in conversations. Last night I was asking a sibling why they are using Alexa upstairs versus the one downstairs. Then the echo dot downstairs starting singing ‚Äúoh technology oh technology‚Äù kind of weird but it seems to have a mind of its own.	1
2044	Love, Love, Love my Amazon Echo Plus!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è	1
2045	The sound quality is not that good, especially for the price that you pay for this. I would recommend to get the Echo Dot and buy a better speaker instead. Maybe Sonos and use the Echo dot.	0
2046	Alexa was able to call my phone when I couldn‚Äôt find it and also turned on and off the light when commanded.  Then I came home a day later and it wouldn‚Äôt turn on the light but would shut it off.  Then she said I had no devices; couldn‚Äôt find my phone.  Now working again.  We will see.  Love the selection of music!	1
2047	I will be returning this piece of garbage as soon as possible. With my lifetime Amazon spending approaching nearly $40,000, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm just a small customer to them, but I‚Äôve rarely been so disappointed out of hundreds if not thousands of Amazon purchases.I have 8+ echos for home automation and bought this Echo Plus specifically for the built-in hub along with approximately $600+ in zigbee light switches. The voice control is subpar even when it works, and that is a rarity. Most often it does nothing. I could not be more disappointed with this product and strongly discourage you from investing in the Amazon/Zigbee ecosystem. If you value your money, and expect a working product then you need to look elsewhere	0
2048	 	1
2049	I love Alexa, she works great but she not for little children. She doesn't understand if you don't speak clearly. She fun to have	1
2050	Holy sound quality batman! This thing jams. It's insanely helpful and just a nice gadget to have around.	1
2051	Very easy to set up and use. Slowly adding devices to truly make our house a smart home. Both Alexa and I are learning what we can do.  With each new item I am happier that I made the purchase.  So far my only regret is I didn‚Äôt do it sooner.	1
2052	Get this in white. I bought it for my girlfriend in white and I wish I had it in white now. Alexa is one of those devices you will always use and miss when it's not around. I find new uses for Alexa every day. I've Incorporated this device into so many parts of my daily life. As Alexa learns more I learn more. She's my alarm clock, she reminds me of important dates. I'm constantly asking her for information like travel, entertainment, science, history, politics Etc. She turns on and off lights, she's the core of my smart home.	1
2053	I love it best gift I got myself	1
2054	I love the sound very good. We use it for home automation also works well!!	1
2055	I really haven‚Äôt found any difference between this and the original version I bought. They both work great	1
2056	Personal	1
2057	We are really enjoying the echo plus. It is fun too.	1
2058	Love Echo, everywhere I go in my house she's always reminding me, playing music or talking to me.  Love her.	1
2059	Very good quality and you don‚Äôt have to yell or be close for it to work and understand you properly	1
2060	So  convenient ! I will never touch the remote again to shut off my tv!!	1
2061	We love everything	1
2062	Easy setup very fun to use. Connects with all my smart home appliances	1
2063	Expensive but it is a slightly better sound than my Original Echo.	1
2064	The sound of the speaker is better than the other Echo I own!	1
2065	I'm loving my easy access to all the music and books I listen to from Amazon music and audible.  The treble, mid and bass sound well-equalized.  I love that I can easily take it to any area of my house and plug it in.  It's nice and light weight, with a good length of cord.	1
2066	This is our first Alexa.... we love it!!	1
2067	So far using it for lights and music. Will connect my tv, vacuum and doorbell soon. Love it!!!!	1
2068	Enjoying it so much!!!	1
2069	I like that it‚Äôs voice activated but it don‚Äôt link with any other Bluetooth devices only Alexa devices	1
2070	It appears to be working fine my first Echo stopped replying to my requests and I received the Echo plus very happy no problems no hassel exchange.	1
2071	This is the best Amazon speaker with Alexa in it.  But if you‚Äôre thinking it‚Äôs a good smart hub you‚Äôre wrong. Are you can do is connect your smart lights and devices to it and tell Alexa to Turn them on and off. That‚Äôs it! You‚Äôre better off buying separate hubs so you have more control of your devices.	1
2072	STILL TRYING TO LINK TO MY SON'S AND DAUGHTER'S IN THEIR ROOMS...	1
2073	 	1
2074	Didn‚Äôt really work as smooth as they make it seem like.	0
2075	it does everything that it offers.	1
2076	LOVE!	1
2077	Besides being fun, it also has many practical aspects--a real bonus for those with vision issues!	1
2078	Works perfect	1
2079	Alexa us funny and enjoyable. Nice sound	1
2080	Echo Plus with built-in Hub - Black ...Amazon	1
2081	Good product I like it . Thank you !	1
2082	It's louder than the dot and it's got a built in hub for all the other wireless controls in the house.	1
2083	Easy set up	1
2084	Was debating between a 4 and a 5 star review. The one challenge with the hub is that Phillips has added functionality that only works with their hub. Basic functionality works with this unit, but now I need two apps to set everything how I want it instead of one, which has caused some user issues. It's woken up a couple times without the trigger word, which I find highly unsettling. We have minor issues with it not always picking up what we say correctly, but it's usually just one or two repeats if that happens.The speaker is great quality and easily covers the kitchen/living room. The sleek design is not obtrusive. My girlfriend has had fun interacting with it and we've had entertaining conversations with it.	1
2085	WORKS GREAT	1
2086	Very happy	1
2087	Love this device	1
2088	I really like this item. I already had the echo dot but with this purchase the Philips Hue bulb came with the plus. Just purchasing the plus I have not had time to use it to its full capabilities but the bulb is something else. I use that with the echo dot to turn on our bedroom light and I really like it. The plus is in our great room/kitchen area. So far I give this a 5 star.	1
2089	Love it!!! Convenient. Responsive. Learns voices within the household. Best assistant so far!	1
2090	I am the Training Coordinator at my company and I have used the Amazon Blueprints skill with an Echo device and Echo Buttons to create my own Gameshow/Quiz for new hire orientation training. I'm always looking for new ways to engage trainees in order to make learning more enjoyable. I believe that if someone enjoys the process of learning then they're much more likely to remember the information. So far, this has been a huge success with my classes and I look forward to Amazon improving and building out the Blueprints skill further!	1
2091	This is a great tool (toy?), room-filling music, very convenient to use, just fun to have. Why only 4 stars? Supposed to work with Logitech Harmony remote: nope. Supposed to work with Denon AV receivers: nope. This may not be Amazon't fault, but advertised skills should actually work. We also have the Echo Show, and the Ring skill works correctly with that device when we want to see who is at the front door.	1
2092	amazing product with amazing sound!	1
2093	I love the Echo Plus mainly because I don't have to worry about putting a CD, in to play. I just command a song and it plays. However; I was disappointed to learn later that it needed to stay plugged in unlike the Echo. After consulting with Amazon and learning that I can purchase a portable Echo charging station I'm good.Sincerely,	1
2094	We love this.	1
2095	As an echo its great, Good sound quality and functionality. As a smart home hub, it sucks. No automation, no geo-fencing, no music syncing for hue, no z-wave. All it does is turn things on with your voice. Ended up buying a smartthing hub and transferring everything over.	0
2096	We have a great time using this as a family. Even my toddler can talk to her . There are a few features I wish it would learn to do  but overall we love it and glad we brought it over the Google home !	1
2097	great	1
2098	Got this a few months ago with the idea that it will help control my smart bulbs and be useful with answering questions and getting daily weather updates.It‚Äôs far from being useful.Half the time when you ‚Äúwake‚Äù the device to ask a question or initiate a command, it doesn‚Äôt hear what you say and turns off. Basically ignoring you. Often she is unable to answer basic questions.It‚Äôs been so frustrating. Alexa has been more work rather than making my life easier.I would return it but I‚Äôm past the return period...... zzzz	0
2099	It is very convenient but wish i could request more music.	1
2100	Ideal when you have Amazon Prime.. My very first Fire TV Stick... I should have purchased one a long time ago.... I wish I bought 2 or 3 on Amazon Prime Day..... And not to forget the fantastic Alexa features..	1
2101	We love it! Finally got one for everyone in the home. Most importantly we‚Äôre saving money that would have otherwise gone to cable.	1
2102	I LOVE my Firestick.	1
2103	I don't know why I held out on getting this for so long.	1
2104	 	1
2105	Cord cutting	1
2106	Works great. Bought as a gift for my boyfriend. Easy & fun to use.	1
2107	 	1
2108	It works great	1
2109	Using it to stream Amazon Prime and Netflix.	1
2110	I put it on a TV that didn‚Äôt have a great picture and it now looks like a new TV	1
2111	Works as expected	1
2112	It is much more difficult to use than the Chromecast.	0
2113	Fast to load. But keeps rebooting  in middle of shows	0
2114	Great!!	1
2115	Works great and it's so easy to use that my 4 year old can navigate it.	1
2116	I live this item.  I bought several for each room in the house and as a gift for my Mom.  I also use mine to travel with.	1
2117	I love how I can just push the microphone button on the remote and ask it to open any show and it'll find whether it's on Hulu or Netflix and sign me in and start the show... Pretty amazing but each new technology sure is making me lazy or lol :-)	1
2118	A great product.  I would buy another.	1
2119	The power cord attachment tends to come loose from the outlet. The adapter may be too long and heavy. Not a big problem but annoying. When the unit is plugged in it works great.	1
2120	Loved it!! Wish I would have bought one sooner.	1
2121	Able to watch all of the shows I love and more.	1
2122	Totally clear picture with numerous channels available. Used for my kitchen tv	1
2123	Very easy to use.	1
2124	Easy to use	1
2125	Love the fire stick. I can download watch great movies. Instead of searching I use Alexa voice.  Prime doesn't offer very many newer movies is the only negative.I also wished there was a way you could set it up to post newest movies first.	1
2126	Very easy to install. Voice control is great.	1
2127	Love it!	1
2128	Great buy at $20!	1
2129	I am guilty of not setting this up, I had my youngest daughter do it. She did not seem to have much trouble figuring it out. So I would have to assume it was not very difficult. I have not tried to use it  yet but my oldest seems to like it so she ordered one for herself.	1
2130	One problem you need to buy an app from amazon to mirroring your iphone .. app price 2.99$ .. other than that the device is perfect	1
2131	 	1
2132	Streaming is easy.  I love it because I can watch Netflix in my bedroom on my TV and not my Ipad	1
2133	Absolutely love it	1
2134	Great product we listen to music all the time	1
2135	Ummm... TV like everyone else.	1
2136	We love the Fire TV Stick and will love it even more when we sever our cable connection when our service agreement expires.	1
2137	Love the TV/movie selection. I really like the fact that I can just rent a movie if they don't have it in their selection.	1
2138	So far no major issues	1
2139	I love it! Super easy to use. Hole the button and speak....takes you right to it without delay :-)	1
2140	Love it...so happy to have everything available through this	1
2141	 	1
2142	Best streaming device I've used in 5 years just wish the remote had a headphone jack like the Roku remote does.	1
2143	Exceeded my expectations	1
2144	New device so still learning about it but works great for us when navigating Hulu.	1
2145	Its ok... my home screen on my fire stick is not working on my television. So by that not working...Alexa will not respond to any questions or commands....I'm going to reach out to Amazon this weekend.	1
2146	So awesome to bring my older tv to life	1
2147	This makes a big difference in searching for programs, so much easier then the older fire stick, faster to.	1
2148	Great and easy to use	1
2149	I used to use my laptop for anything show watching, including Netflix, but I am glad I bought this. This is super easy to set up and has everything you need with quick and easy access. Definitely worth the buy.	1
2150	I just think that it's to darn confusing. And there are parts that i would try and just wouldn't work. I just don't like it. Not what i thought it would be.	0
2151	Easy to set up and use,	1
2152	I will never buy anything Amazon makes again!This fire stick is not even a year old and it does nothing but restart and freeze up constantly. No warranty from Amazon in this should have been my first clue that it was a horrible device. I will never buy anything built by Amazon again.	0
2153	Great buy. Recommend getting Kodi with some movie addons	1
2154	The firestick is easy to use and was super easy to set up.  I like the platform and feel it is better than I expected.  I was worried about it lagging but it has not at all.  I‚Äôm hoping to utilize the firestick to eventually break away from cable and now I‚Äôm more confident that it can happen.	1
2155	Works much easier than our 3 year old one. Better internet resemption	1
2156	Works amazing! I love how you can download almost anything. Some apps I couldn‚Äôt download on my Apple TV but I was able too on here!!!	1
2157	The Fire TV Stick was easy to set up and use. Only downfall is, subscriptions are needed to view premium content.	1
2158	Prime video	1
2159	Love it! It's everything I wanted and more	1
2160	I like the way you can watch anything and everything , for some live shows you need a cable provider	1
2161	Es  excelente funciona genial	1
2162	Was loving it but starting in June Hulu stopped working and crunchyroll doesn‚Äôt work either. Probably will switch to something else soon.	0
2163	Puts the pep back in my old TV.  All of the software was expired and I enjoy NETFLIX and Amazon Prime Video.  Now I have all of my favorite Video on the TV again......	1
2164	Haven't used it enough	1
2165	The Fire Stick has been amazing! Easy  setup and easy to use! An awesome deal on Prime Day!	1
2166	Love the fire stick and the amazon customer service!!!	1
2167	Easy to use and setup.	1
2168	Great streaming device	1
2169	Works as expected, very easy to setup and use	1
2170	Awesome product!	1
2171	The selection is wonderful and the ease of use on the home page is nice. I wish, however, it didn't keep overcoming my settings for my other devices attached to my TV.  I have to keep switching back after any switches in programming, including my stereo.	1
2172	Bought the 2nd firestick for bedroom. Easily installed and set up. Works great	1
2173	Great interface.  i enjoy the voice remote	1
2174	I liked it was linked to prime	1
2175	It good	1
2176	I love it	1
2177	I already bought one previously to try out and enjoyed it.  Bought these new ones during the Prime sale.	1
2178	Works like a charm. Fast delivery and no problems.	1
2179	ok	1
2180	I loved it so much on my living room TV that I bought one for the bedroom TV. Highly recommend this device to anyone wanting to simplify and improve their online entertainment experience.	1
2181	Does everything I need!	1
2182	Love it love it love it	1
2183	awesome device	1
2184	CAN WATCH AMAZON PRIME SHOWS AND TALK TO ALEXUS	1
2185	This product replaces the 1st generation Fire Stick I had, and what an improvement in speed in both showing Amazon content but ALL apps downloaded on PRODUCT! I bought in on PRIME day for $19 .... BEST DEAL EVER !	1
2186	Just as advertised, bought as a gift, great price, fast shipping!!	1
2187	 	1
2188	Very easy to set up and straight forward directions. Loads fast also.	1
2189	I purchased the Fire Stick to be able to watch movies at my convenience. I love that there is such a variety of genres. I also enjoy it gives you the ability to watch TV shows too. It's Awesome!	1
2190	Being able to tell it what to go to	1
2191	Love this! So many options!	1
2192	I love it	1
2193	Love it. Many stations to choose from	1
2194	It was a gift.	1
2195	It still doesn‚Äôt work.  I bet if I call and let them know that, they will charge me for the 3rd time.  Ridiculous.	0
2196	I love the Alexa remote and easy to use.	1
2197	 	0
2198	works great	1
2199	It is very easy to use,I can now watch my favorite movies	1
2200	Doubtful at first, but it works a lot better than my smart devices.Plus Alexa software include, that was a plus!	1
2201	Love our Fire Stick,easy to set up and have loads of shows for free and plenty to rent or buy.We also use Pluto TV and Tubi so that's even more TV.Alexa makes it so easy to find any show or movie I want.We love the money we save.	1
2202	It was perfect.  Works like a charm.	1
2203	Netflix and Hulu	1
2204	I love this fire stick because after installing a few highly recommended apps, I discovered that a lot of the channels I don't have with my cable provider is included,  and I don't have to pay extra! Just subscribing to a few streaming apps will do and I still come out paying way less than cable tv.	1
2205	Love this wished I had gotten it sooner	1
2206	Makes accessing all of the Apps easy. Love the voice control.	1
2207	It's my second one and works well	1
2208	I love my fire stick!	1
2209	Great product. Very versatile and easy to use	1
2210	Ease of usage	1
2211	I love this, it's quick and easy to use. I love that there are so many apps you can access but disappointed some of them cost extra money to use. I also love the music app on here. I didn't think I would use it because I have Alexa echo and listen to music all the time on there. But I tried it on the fire tv and it gives you the lyric as the songs play! Love it!!	1
2212	Love it. The only downside is that you can't download any app you want.	1
2213	Still learning how to use it but like it so far. We played music from YouTube and a couple movies on it. No complaints	1
2214	We are using the internet for our home and loving them	1
2215	My Father liked the added programing in which he is interested.	1
2216	I love my fire stick	1
2217	Love it and how easy it is to use. One of the best Prime Day purchases we have made.	1
2218	Satisfied with the purchase	1
2219	Im able to connect to prime quick	1
2220	ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT SO EASY TO USE BETTER THAN SCROLLING CHANNELS.	1
2221	 	0
2222	Loved it. No more cable bills for us.  I would advise anyone to get one. 2nd one bought.	1
2223	I bought it for my sister and she hasn't had any complaints yet so I think it's great!	1
2224	absolutely an amazing device, very easy to setup and use	1
2225	The current demand for this stick, was too high for the power coming out of my USB port on the TV. Had to run the power cable to the supplied USB adapter. Not a big deal but added another cable showing on my wall mounted TV.	1
2226	Works very well for Amazon and Netflix but will not a let all viewing platforms like VUDU. It also will shut down if HULU is played for more than a couple minutes and yes I have it directly plugged into the wall so low power source is not an issue (even checked outlet voltage) an issue which is typically the answer you get for that issue.over all the quality of the picture is quiet well and is a user friendly platform to use If they would fix those two issues I would have one on every tv in the house but as it sits this will be our only one. to bad to because I relay like amazon products and having Alexa is always nice	1
2227	Love the Firestick thinking about canceling the satellite	1
2228	I'm amazed at how many movies, tv shows and more is available. I am planning to drop cable service soon and am very happy to know I'll have lots of viewing pleasure with the Fire stick and not pay the outrageous cable bills.	1
2229	Easy to setup.  Sometimes Alexis does not work the greatest. The connection fire stick and WiFi is way bettter than Netflix .	1
2230	Works great	1
2231	Ease of use.	1
2232	Finally bought one but it couldn't find my Wi-Fi. Had to buy a Wi-Fi extended. My smart t.v. used the Wi-Fi just fine.	1
2233	This firestick is everything!	1
2234	Recently cut the cord on cable television. Needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap. Ordered the Amazon Fire Stick from Best Buy. Instructions were short and easy to follow. I was going to order the Amazon Ethernet Adapter because I was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought I'd wait and see. Glad I did. Wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. A few brief hiccups here and there, but I'm convinced that was from the Apps themselves. Don't miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what I used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. Amazon Fire Stick is limited to 1GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading Apps and recording shows. So far it hasn't been any issue at all. The upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of NFL Football, might prove more troublesome when I need to record more often. I'll worry about that then. My only real issue is that you can't really turn it off. The screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. Luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded Apps and recorded shows stay in memory. Not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it's unplugged. Haven't tried it yet, although I don't think it'll be an issue with DirectTV Now, which I'm using right now. So far I'm loving the Amazon Fire Stick. Actually love that Amazon, which I use occasionally, come pre-installed.	1
2235	Everything	1
2236	Love this!	1
2237	Really enjoying my firestick can‚Äôt wait to get rid of  cable such a waste of money.	1

2246	Amazing device	1
2247	Great product.	1
2248	This was a replacement of an older version of Fire Stick. I haven't tried the Alexa voice part of this remote yet, but it works great.	1
2249	I bought and love them. Alexa is very convenient.	1
2250	Like	1
2251	I don't have Alexa, but after getting this I'm feeling inspired to get one. I feel this is a good gateway and or Alexa trial, and liking it so far.  Channels work just fine like Apple TV, just need to check if there is a phone app for a keyboard typing, because spelling things out on keyboard sucks for searching YouTube clips	1
2252	I definitely like this product.  Wanted to be able to watch Netflix on my tv!  Easy to install!	1
2253	‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê	1

2257	Works wonderfully.	1

2267	Great ! It was the best decision ! Especially if you have Amazon Prime.	1
2268	I love everything about the fire stick. It‚Äôs easy to use and Alexa makes it quicker to get to tv shows or music.	1
2269	Works great! Alexa finds all the goodies you could ask for!	1
2270	I was able to use this in another room and add Alexa in that room.	1
2271	Works great, speed is fast. Exactly what we needed	1
2272	This was just an additional one for my other TV. Loved it so much use it on the regular TV. Easy to set up and fairly easy to navigate. I don‚Äôt waste my money on regular TV cable or anything else. This is enough for me as I don‚Äôt watch too much TV.	1
2273	I love this! It‚Äôs user friendly and better than any streaming device we have previously used. I wish we had purchased sooner and purchased more of them.	1
2274	My 90 year old Mom LOVES that she can watch the 1st Season of Blue Bloods ‚ù§. My one wish is that she could watch CSI:MIAMI...without having to pay for it...üò• The bill for OPTIMUM is already, quite high. Can you help us? We live on Long Island, NY (Suffolk County )	1
2275	Excellent	1
2276	I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!  It‚Äôs just what l needed and MORE!!!  I didn‚Äôt realize that the remote included voice remote.  HOW CONVENIENT!!!!  I‚Äôm so glad that l made that purchase!!!!	1
2277	It‚Äôs better than I thought, it practically turns your regular tv into a smart tv!	1
2278	Lovee it! It has evrything I need it, now I cant even get my dad out of my room hahahaha... movie addicts.	1
2279	Works great to watch youtube and amazin video	1
2280	Like it alots, something different than traditional television. The use of Alexa is nice too.	1
2281	Works well I have several of these recommend to anyone	1
2282	Awesome, wish I had gotten one sooner.	1
2283	Great product	1
2284	Works great no lag and is much better than the gen 1 devices I was using. I would recommend this if you have a 1rst gen and are tired of the lag and crashes.	1
2285	Works great. Easy set up.	1
2286	Love it so easy to use	1
2287	I love the firestick ! It's easy to set up and use. It rarely stops to buffer and. It  would be a bargain at twice the price.	1
2288	I do like the Fire Stick and I‚Äôm very close to cutting the cable.  I can find many movies and shows, while keeping my budget in check.  I‚Äôm learning how to maneuver around the channels and find my shows quickly.	1
2289	Simple install and love the voice activation	1
2290	We haven‚Äôt used it much yet.  We like what we have used. My husband loves it.	1
2291	very easy to set up and very easy to use	1
2292	Once connected it brought so many options to view. We connected with quite a few of the channels.Must have,	1
2293	Great product. Had a bit of a problem to download kodi but once it is done. You get all the movies Tv programs.	1
2294	Very impressed.  Simple to use	1
2295	Perfect for streaming our shows. Ditched cable and we are in love!	1

2298	This thing is awesome. We watch it more then the regular cable. Going to by more on Black Friday as Christmas gifts.	1
2299	Love all the options with the fire tv stick!Works great!	1
2300	The menu''s are cumbersome to get your apps set up.	1
2301	Easy to use	1
2302	Awesome	1
2303	Good shape	1
2304	I‚Äôm very unhappy with this Firestick, every time we change programs or channels within a program there is a very long delay. We have 2 Roku‚Äôs That work just fine and are very quick.	0
2305	Had to return it as Hulu does not work on device.  It kept coming up with errors, and Hulu app not being able to open at times.  It was hit and miss, and at times, Hulu will stop working right in the middle of a show or movie.  Plus fire stick is very slow in opening the apps.	0
2306	I love my amazon sticks	1
2307	I like being able to watch pretty much anything I want at anytime. Works great!	1
2308	I love my fire stick. It is so easy to use.	1
2309	The Firestick we were sent doesn‚Äôt work. At all.  Voice remote won‚Äôt even turn on. We did all the troubleshooting steps. Didn‚Äôt work. Contacted Amazon. They sent us a new one - with no remote/no way to control it! We gave up and got a Roku (which works great!)	0
2310	Just the perfect cost effective solution.  Thank you Amazon.	1
2311	Firestick easy to use and I enjoyed it.	1
2312	i do wish the dot could connect to the fire stick but both products still worked flawlessly	1
2313	My old amazon fire stick kept crashing when using Sling TV.I bought this one thinking the old one was defective.This one is doing the same thing. When going back into Sling, it starts up where I left off in the program.	0
2314	Ordered 2 on deal day. 1 doesn‚Äôt work and 2 nd just went down after 2 days üòè	0
2315	Love my fire stick and remote, so easy to set up and use. Endless amounts of apps to download! Used it with my smart tv and it‚Äôs 100X better than the features smart TVs offer	1
2316	Great easy to set up.A little difficult to navigate and the instructions are non existent	1
2317	Super good!	1
2318	Fun taking to the TV. Works good. It‚Äôs a little confusing moving around the programs.	1
2319	That it doesn‚Äôt turn my television on or off.	1
2320	"I loved how easy this was to install sry up, and use! Simply amazing.  So amazing we bought two!This allowed us to officially ""CUT THE CABLE CORD"".Love it!"	1
2321	I expected to have access to more current movie instead of having to pay. The easy setup was helpful and I love the speedy delivery.	1
2322	Works great! I recommend it to anyone who has prime, WiFi and an hdm1 tv. That‚Äôs all u need. I‚Äôm not really technologically savvy but even I was able to set it up with included and on screen directions.	1
2323	need a few more	1
2324	I love that you can watch Bob Dylan‚Äôs movies	1
2325	Love the Alexa feature. Firestick is working just fine.	1
2326	Very easy to install.  Very intuitive to use.  Very happy with the purchase.	1
2327	Ease of use!	1
2328	I don't like how I cannot load my Hulu account, it is also very slow. I know it is not my Internet connection because I have an Xbox One that works just fine, but my Fire TV Stick takes forever to load anything.	0
2329	Amazing for all your entertainment needs!	1
2330	It's constantly buffering, to the point where you can't watch anything without interruption. I purchased on Prime Day plus I used rewards to pay for it, so in the end I paid next to nothing. If I had paid full price for it I might want my money back. We stopped trying to use it and went back to our old streaming device. I know our internet service is not the issue because we do not have this problem with any other devices that we stream from.	0
2331	I didn‚Äôt realize it needed an external power source in order to utilize the fire stick. I thought it was more along the lines of a flash drive device you Singley plugged into your tv. However, since using my amazon fire stick I have enjoyed every moment of it and would definitely recommend this product to any and all.	1
2332	I love it!!!!!!	1
2333	Easy to install and operate. Works with Alexa voice commands.	1
2334	This was a Prime Day purchase. I'm still learning my way around it. So far, so good. The addition of Alexa is nice.	1
2335	I love how it is Alexa enabled. I just say the show I want to watch and &#34;she&#34; knows how and where to find it for me!	1
2336	Super easy to set up.  Easy to use. Lots of app options available.	1
2337	The first stick is a solid, entry level, device and does what it's supposed to do.	1
2338	Works fine, I wanted this for my bedroom television.	1
2339	Does not work with you tube tv	1
2340	Easy to set up; Easy to use!	1
2341	I love all the viewing choices on FIRE STICK!	1
2342	Good product	1
2343	This is my 2nd fire TV stick with Alexa I have been very happy with my first one love that you can use so many apps with it. Big üëç	1
2344	Love the Firestick! My kids love that they can talk to Alexa and get the weather, local news, etc.	1
2345	It offers hours of entertainment and it was very easy to install and activate üëç	1
2346	amazon fire stick is amazing !!!	1
2347	I have 2 of them the one I have to reset it at least once a week or so some times twice	1
2348	Awesome product more than expected	1
2349	I don‚Äôt like that it goes into sleep mode after 20-30 minutes of ‚Äúinactivity‚Äù. I shouldn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù the fire tv to finish watching a show.	0
2350	availability of movies and nothing I don't like	1
2351	Very satisfied, easy setup. Great product. Highly recommend.	1
2352	We like it better than Roku.  Voice commands really work.	1
2353	Easy setup, works flawlessly!	1
2354	Easy to hook up.  Wish I knew all its capabilities	1
2355	Great Purchase	1
2356	Easy to set up	1
2357	It was easy to use for our bedroom TV.	1
2358	I used Chromecast before this, it was okay. But I love the FireStick. Works great, doesn‚Äôt lag. Would recommend!	1
2359	 	1
2360	I bought this fire stick for another TV! No more arguments about what to watch!	1
2361	I liked it until on day after a year it no longer worked, would not power up  and go past the firestick  logo on tv. Bought a second one, will not buy a third if this one doesn't last longer....	0
2362	We love our fire stick!! The Alexa voice control is fantastic for my younger kids!!	1
2363	Setup was easy and usage was intuitive.  I've used it away from home and it works great.	1
2364	I really love that all my apps are in one spot	1
2365	I love the number of movies that are available using this device. Took me a little time to setup and learn how to work it. The only thing I miss is local channels.	1
2366	Love that the fire stick allows me enough choices to ditch cable!	1
2367	Plenty of options to choose from!	1
2368	It worked as a charmed.	1
2369	I love it . Easy set up as well	1
2370	I love how fast you get a respond from Alexa.Also easy to find any thing you are looking forjust speak in to the remote.	1
2371	Extremely easy to use! Switched away from directv and use it to stream T.V.	1
2372	It don‚Äôt show nothing	0
2373	Works like a charm!	1
2374	Works great, some of the apps will start buffering but it‚Äôs probably my internet. Love the Alexa voice control.	1
2375	It does what it says it will do.  The picture quality is better than what I have been receiving on cable TV.  Only downside is if you pause the movie for more than a couple minutes it takes a long time to come back on and you often get a message that your internet speed is too slow (I'm clocking 300 mb at my house on a good day).  Also, voice command through Alexia doesn't work well, but that could be operator error.  All in all, for $20 you can't beat it.	1
2376	I loved everything	1
2377	Very disappointed when we had to mandatory upgrade and when we final got done with the upload, we had lost our local Charlotte NC channels (which are pur news and weather also)  (CBS, NBC, ABC) and 2 days later was Amazon day with discounts on what we had JUST ordered.	0
2378	Second one for my house. This is great...I am not tech oriented and all I have to do is hold down a button and talk. Now I am watching tv too much! LOL!	1
2379	I love this thing! The Alexa feature makes it so easy to find what you want no matter which streaming service has it.  No more searching Netflix then Amazon etc to see if either has your show,  Alexa finds it for you!	1
2380	Great product	1
2381	Love it!	1
2382	I feel that the voice feature is useless. Lots of channels to stream though.	1
2383	Garbage...Even trying to watch Amazon Prime Video this piece of garbage looses internet connection half way thru a show. The cheapest Roku works 100 time better. DO not waste your time or money on this piece of garbage.	0
2384	Loved it.	1
2385	Love the fire stick. Alexa works well on it too. Would recommend.	1
2386	Just getting started with the Fire TV Stick. So far, so good.	1
2387	Easy to set up, lots of things to watch and program in.  Have not even gotten that far into it yet.  Easy to use. Highly recommended.  Leaning more and more closer to cutting the cable cord for good.	1
2388	Was a gift	1
2389	This is my second Firestick, I a very pleased with the ease of use.	1
2390	I would not recommend this to anyone. It won't load netflix or if it does on rare occasion it won't run the program all the way thru. It tells you the we are unable to process this title at this time. Try again later.  It is not the Netflix site cause I can stream it just fine on my computer.  Its the Firestick. very disappointing.	0
2391	Worth every cent.	1
2392	I like when thete nothing to watch on tv I can run to my firestick.	1
2393	Access to apps	1
2394	Easy to install and use.	1
2395	Thank you! Great Product!	1
2396	Purchased this for the Man cave and loving it.	1
2397	las pel√≠culas no tiene o no se pueden cambiar a espa√±ol o t√≠tulos en espa√±ol	0
2398	Easy to install. Up and running in minutes.	1
2399	Was excited to try this on my new Element TV.  Unfortunately even though my TV is 5 feet away from my router i get maddening disconnections and buffering.  Thought this little device was supposed to take care of that issue.  It didn‚Äôt!	0
2400	Easy to use, all your favorite programs. All inclusive, nothing else to buy.	1
2401	Fun to play with	1
2402	as of now,i love everything about it	1
2403	Powerful little stick	1
2404	Superb is all we can say.  Plugged the unit in, set up the HDMI and boom, we were watching better TV.  Thank you.	1
2405	It's like having your tv as a big tablet	1
2406	Loved them	1
2407	I am very pleased with the Fire Stick.	1
2408	works good, ni issues	1
2409	great price great product fire stick is the best i think works better then roku.	1
2410	Love how I can take it on vacation and use it. Very easy to set up.	1
2411	As a user of Chromecast for years I have to say that the Firestick is a nice upgrade. I really like that I can download all the apps for different media sources like HBO, Showtime, etc. that I have free access to from my cable account but with the Firestick I get a better picture and can go directly to the shows I want to see. The downside was the time it took to download all the apps and set them up, but the good thing is that the setup is a onetime procedure.	1
2412	Currently own 3 Chromecast devices and tge Fire Stick is superior to them.  We are so pleased that we can watch programs on Netflix and Prime without a smart phone or computer.  Very easy to install and use!	1
2413	Menu doesn‚Äôt work. Says it can‚Äôt connect to amazon network	0
2414	I would love this remote if i wasnt spending so much money replacing the batteries. Its upsetting that i spent money on such a great device all for the batteries not to last.	0
2415	This was purchased for our toy hauler, but it came the day before we left for a trip by plane.  It was wonderful to plug into our hotel TV and watch our normal tv shows rather than whatever was showing at the time and sit through commercials.	1
2416	Already had a firestick in our livingroom, great entertainment, had to get one for the bedroom.	1
2417	very good option	1
2418	Purchased to use on the road in my semi. Does not work in that application.	0
2419	Great	1
2420	I love my fire stick thank you so much	1
2421	Easy to set-up!  I am enjoying the added video choices for my television.	1
2422	The installation and connection to my Wi-Fi was so easy! Getting the Amazon Prime and Netflix going was a breeze. I have not used a voice remote before. That was amazing (yes, I am old school). I will be reviewing more features and options as I have time, but I am very excited to own such a product that lives up to the all the great things I have read and heard.	1
2423	I like this product. However, the set up was a bit difficult. I had to reset it to the factory setting abd start from scratch.	1
2424	I loved the I can use voice to make a request. I use it for music and movies.	1
2425	Very easy to install and am excited to use!	1
2426	so far, so good, works great.	1
2427	Great device, I'm cutting my cable and watching the channels I want. If I want to add an app like CBS I can just pay a little extra and get it.	1
2428	Everything about it is great, love the Alexa voice remote	1
2429	Works like a charm...	1
2430	 	1
2431	Thought it was pretty cool new to streaming thing seemed easy to use	1
2432	Super-Easy setup, only issue i find is that it occasionally loses connection with household network.	1
2433	Turned our old TV into a smart TV. Really easy interface. Have bought 4 now.	1
2434	Easy set up, works perfect.	1
2435	This is an awesome product. I wanted to test out the differences between this and my Roku and both are very nice. I will likely be using this for traveling as well.	1
2436	üòÑüòÑ	1
2437	Good wifi TV stick	1
2438	I love it	1
2439	Seems to work ok, but no youtube tv?  Really?  can't believe they would ban an app that so many people want to use.  I really wanted to like it, but when I couldn't install that particular app it became almost useless, almost.  Does most other stuff just fine, but I'll stick with my Roku.	0
2440	This thing is great if you have internet and amazon prime.	1
2441	Awesome product	1
2442	Easy set up, nice looking interface and I like the new slightly larger remote. I have a 1st Gen with the little remote and misplace it all the time. And great price!	1
2443	Great product and easy to use	1
2444	Great gadget that installs, and works easily. Nice to not have another box taking up space too!	1
2445	Excellent product and service.  Very easy to install and my daughter is very happy.	1
2446	Great entertainment	1
2447	Being able to use it with my Alexa Echo was great!	1
2448	Easy to use and fast setup	1
2449	LOVE IT!!!!!	1
2450	I set her up to play through our home theater system. So fat we are just using her for weather forecasts, cooking timers, and we really enjoy the music!	1
2451	Small device that my kids like to ask questions. Very handy friendly interactive	1
2452	beyond awesome	1
2453	I like that it responds every time. It was easy to set up.  I'm still learning what I can do with it. I may like a better speaker more.	1
2454	Family loved it!	1
2455	 	1
2456	I like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the Google. Only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker. Easy to use.	1
2457	Echos are great I have a few of them through out our home .  All in voice range to ask a question. Say a command to turn lights on or off. Or my favorite is play music all though the house.	1
2458	Love it , this time it's a gift  for friend	1
2459	Fantastic product, I use it as a smart home hub and to play music through speakers mainly, the customizable routines are so nice and very easy to program	1
2460	Great	1
2461	I am quite disappointed by this product.There clearly is a bug: half of the time I ask for a newsflash, two second after it starts, the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes. Same goes when I ask to play the radio. Also, many times it get confused when I ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true. Clearly no AI or natural language, very 'beta' stage still for me. Not impressed!	0
2462	Love this thing works great and kids love it to	1
2463	Love it.. makes the simple things in life simpler	1
2464	I am really enjoying the many different features on my Alexa, especially listening to music and audio books	1
2465	Echo Dot is a wonderful invention. We love it. Alexa is so smart.	1
2466	Alarm and music, information the weather	1
2467	Love it! Very helpful	1
2468	Good but it‚Äôs pretty low	1
2469	Alarm, calendar, reminders	1
2470	I have had the echo dot for about two weeks and am having fun with it. I set morning alarms, check the weather, have Alexa play various music (I bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound), and I'm learning her skills. A little tricky to connect to wifi initially, but after some trial and error it connected, and has stayed connected. So far, super satisfied. Will be buying one for my mother and one for my office.	1
2471	I AM COMPLETELY IN LOVE. DOES ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING AND IS SO AMAZING AND GREAT	1
2472	Nope. Still a lot to be improved. For most of the things we ask.. It says.. Hmmmm.. I dont know that.	0
2473	The speaker could be better...	1
2474	I love it!!	1
2475	3rd Dot. Love it!	1
2476	works like any other one!	1
2477	Love my new Alexa. She works great so far.	1
2478	I bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and I was excited when it came in the next day. I set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can't use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It's very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could. If any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know!	1
2479	I got this for dad on father's Day!  He was tickled with it!	1
2480	Nice product	1
2481	Love my echo. Love playing music in my room	1
2482	Still getting used to Alexa, but I think she's a keeper!	1
2483	Works good for the most part. You ask it some questions and she says she doesn‚Äôt know. I thought she was supposed to know everything	1
2484	my new best friend :)	1
2485	Absolutely love it!!!!	1
2486	I liked linking two more rooms in the home	1
2487	I LOVE ALEXA!! SHE ROCKS!!!	1
2488	I had some trouble with my echo dot when I first got it because of internet connection issues. After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it's little rough patch and I haven't had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device.	1
2489	Small size works great in our sunroom.	1
2490	I like it and it‚Äôs helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon.	1
2491	I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for.	0
2492	It won‚Äôt work as a blue tooth speaker with my tv,it connects but won‚Äôt work	1
2493	I've only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time I did use it. It was fun trying to use Alexa	1
2494	This was an impulse buy but turns out I really enjoy my new dot. My grands love requesting songs and playing games. I like listening to my audible selection, keeping up with my to do lists and discovering new Alexa skills. Fun and practical, my echo dot has been a surprisingly welcome addition to my home.	1
2495	Great product at a great price.	1
2496	My son loves his Echo Dot.	1
2497	Love these.  Great in the bathroom to listen to the news during showering.  Or listen to CNN live with Serius SM.	1
2498	I like it alot. I connected it so I can play my Pandora and I asked about the weather & time every morning. I got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because I can have my music play Unlimited on this. I'm going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once I get more comfortable with it. Definitely worth the money.	1
2499	It plays music that I request.	1
2500	I didn't like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.	0
2501	Luv it.  It's a great product.	1
2502	What can I say. Well, I‚Äôm a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that‚Äôs not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.	1
2503	Great product	1
2504	Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely.	1
2505	Easy to set up, can control Kasa smart plugs no problem.  Even the kids have figured stuff out that I would not have asked Alexa, like telling jokes and singing. The Alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam.	1
2506	I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don't like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. Lol	1
2507	Alarm,bed time story, universal	1
2508	I am in love with alexa	1
2509	Its was easy to set up	1
2510	 	1
2511	Works better than anticipated. This thing is awesome.	1
2512	Great product	1
2513	Really like it	1
2514	I like that it respond most of my comands. Great product.	1
2515	The volume is very low	0
2516	so far i am liking it although i am probably not using it to the full capasity	1
2517	My new best friend!! I'm a little behind the times I've never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. I use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. I use it for my amazon audible books. Set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. Have her tell me a short story lol. It's pretty fun. I know some people complained about the speaker I'm not sure why. I'm sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough. But I rent a room and in my bedroom it's perfect I don't have any problems with the speaker. Love everything about it!	1
2518	Wish volume was capable of going louder	1
2519	I love it	1
2520	Best purchase this year.	1
2521	I love these, I have 2 dots and one echo. For a medium size rooms these are loud enough without external speakers although I do use external for the dots.	1
2522	I really love my dots! So awesome how it‚Äôs connects all my rooms. But like you‚Äôve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. Which I‚Äôm sure if I connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. But as a stand alone the volume is just ok. Definitely not like my tall echo. And the dots don‚Äôt pick up voice as good as my tall echo.Still totally love them and would recommend 100%	1
2523	its okay but keeps dropping wifi!	1
2524	Kids love it! I love it!	1
2525	 	0
2526	Love my echo dot easy to use and set up	1
2527	love it as I do all of my echos	1
2528	Excellent product !!	1
2529	I love being able to control lights, doors and music.	1
2530	Fun To interact with	1
2531	Very satisfied with the product	1
2532	We have 3 echos now, even one in the barn, great idea for when I am working with my horse, can still get news flashes & my music!	1
2533	I bought this for my healing room.  I play continuous spa like music. Although Alexa knows the type of music needed, the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled.  I didn't know I had to buy speakers too.	1
2534	Like having the music where ever I am.	1
2535	Hard to hear, had to blue tooth it to a better speaker.	1
2536	No problems, works as expected. Could have a better speaker.	1
2537	I love it...... I want to get another one very  very  soon	1
2538	Great to have along with the Echo	1
2539	this is my 2nd echo dot and it is working just as i want it to.  i have it in the bedroom and i par it with a small blue tooth speaker.  last nite i went to sleep with sounds of a thunderstorm as provided by my echo dot.  i am planning to have the dot turn my bedroom lamps on when i receive the smart plugs that i ordered.	1
2540	daughter wanted a white boombox, nothing good out for 11 yr old.  decided to go echo dot for most any request + white BT good speaker.  she loved the gift and nice option for many things on the internet.	1
2541	Cheap and cheap sound.	0
2542	This is pretty cool	1
2543	Some times Alexa is a little &#34;thick&#34;, but mostly good!	1
2544	Love it!! Don‚Äôt know what took me so long to get one ‚Äî and don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt get two on Amazon Prime Day!	1
2545	Up dated news	1
2546	Works like a champ.	1
2547	Clear sound, great alarm clock, plays my music.  What else can you ask for.  Oh yeah, you can order what you need.	1
2548	Love that you can use your cell phone to call Echo or Dot. You can also use Echo and Dot as intercoms.	1
2549	love it...just like the other 4 I own.	1
2550	Great price.  I love my echo dot,	1
2551	Excellent. Bought another one yesterday!	1
2552	works great	1
2553	Love this!!! My daughter enjoys telling Alexa what to do. Haha	1
2554	Purchased this for a discount on Prime Day to insert into a portable Bluetooth speaker made specifically to work with Echo Dot. Works great, love it! Now I can bring Alexa out onto the patio with me, and I mostly use it for music. This is our 3rd Echo product and we love them!	1
2555	Just got my third one. Love them	1
2556	The ease in installing	1
2557	Un excelente equipo inteligente al estar conectado al internet nos provee de m√∫ltiples funciones tales como, el tiempo,hora,informaci√≥n de cualquier estudio que est√©s realizando atr√°s vez del internet.	1
2558	For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn‚Äôt know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don‚Äôt like that it‚Äôs not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don‚Äôt. Lastly, I‚Äôm sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven‚Äôt quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù.	0
2559	I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don't like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it's an ok item.	1
2560	Love the echo dot it‚Äôs amaxing!!!	1
2561	I like to use it for listening to podcasts.  I like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what's new.  The one thing I don't like was getting it to recognize the radio station I wanted to listen to.  I finally got it working, but had to work through the bugs.	1
2562	Just like it's big sister, the Echo, only smaller, with slightly less audio fidelity, but much lower price (on amazon prime day:-)Used in another room to add Alexa to an additional room.	1
2563	It does everything  the big guy does	1
2564	Great product - understands my accent!	1
2565	Love it... can't stop using it..	1
2566	Really like the availability to get instant music throughout the house.	1
2567	 	1
2568	very handy in the kitchen, sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps.	1
2569	Cool little speaker..I love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great!!	1
2570	It is s great tool helping with information.	1
2571	Used twice not working!!!!!!!	0
2572	Awesome piece of technology that has simplified my life. Great purchase.	1
2573	I jumped on the bandwagon by purchasing an Echo.  I feel like there was a struggle getting connected and then three days later, the device is sharing news and weather.  Now we use it some, but have not tapped in to all options.  Still testing it out.	1
2574	Love Alexa. Love the Echo Dot but we have trouble with the speakers when using the intercom.	1
2575	Love it , Now if I can only find the correct smart (links)Plug to connect this too	1
2576	Work pretty well	1
2577	Still learning it	1
2578	We really love our Echo Dot, we can get questions answered right away and play any music we can think of.	1
2579	Usual reliable Alexa	1
2580	Speaker could be better qualty	1
2581	This device does not interact with my home filled with Apple devices.  How disappointing!	0
2582	Have the echo wanted something smaller in another room  they work together great	1
2583	Love it!! It is so handy and easy to use. Got it for my classroom, but I many need to just get another one.	1
2584	Very pleased	1
2585	Primarily for music in our bedroom.  I wish the speaker had better fidelity.	1
2586	Nice	1
2587	Music, weather, time.	1
2588	Great, love it!	1
2589	Not all that happy. The speaker isn‚Äôt great and for some reason a lot of times when I play music it will start to make some weird noise and just stop. My son has a google home and it is much better	0
2590	Not impressed	1
2591	I really like it .	1
2592	it takes a while to learn the uses and I'm still learning!	1
2593	Alexa is phenomenal!	1
2594	When you think about it this really doesn‚Äôt do much. Play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. I can see why price is dropping like a rock.	0
2595	The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it's not awkward, and it doesn't take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing.	1
2596	I use the echo dot several different ways in my home. I use it downstairs to control lighting. I also take it out on my deck to stream music to a Bluetooth speaker. It works great for what I need.	1
2597	I have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom. It was even easier to set up than my original echo.	1
2598	Makes turning on and off things in the house so simple. Great for little updates as well, like checking the weather and such.	1
2599	Great product, fun to use!!	1
2600	Needs to be smarter	1
2601	I really enjoy being able to just make a request  for my favorite music and it happens I have no complaints at this time...	1
2602	Love it. Works great making my home a smarthome	1
2603	I really like the echo dot. It‚Äôs amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot.	1
2604	Convenient and fun.	1
2605	It's alright....	1
2606	this is my first Alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation!	1
2607	I love searching the Alexa skill shop on the app. Useful things like having Alexa turn my lights on and off, listening to news updates every morning. And fun stuff like telling Alexa to make the Star Trek red alert nois. Or playing song quiz with friends.	1
2608	Second dot.	1
2609	Son loves it.	1
2610	I love how compact it is.	1
2611	This worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet (wifi) and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked.  Amazon customer service couldn't help further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, so they weren't willing to replace.	0
2612	It talks to me, plays the type of music i want to listen to, and even turns off when I ask if to.	1
2613	Ask it to play Motown radio on Pandora and it keeps asking if I want to add a salsa station. Motown isn‚Äôt close to salsa phonetically.	0
2614	Love it, we are still learning the capabilities, having a lot of fun.	1
2615	Easy to set up. Still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug. Grandkids think Alex is cool!	1
2616	I love it! I use it for everything. It‚Äôs a part of my daily routine	1
2617	The Alexa program is great, but the quality is not the best. It could definitely be louder.	1
2618	Overall I like this. Though Siri on my phone can do more for what I need as I don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù and don‚Äôt intend to make it one. But it‚Äôs fun and I use it for music and to have it read me my audible books.	1
2619	Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn't work.	1
2620	Set up is so easy.	1
2621	Love it	1
2622	I'm amazed with the alarm. I tell Alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does.  I love the play list if music. Not sure if i don't keep prime if music will still be available. However i did love the fact Amazon gave me music free for 3 months...they should have given prime free for 3 months as well.	1
2623	I love all of the things that it can do. I can play with it and learn from it.	1
2624	Been debating on getting one, but am happy I did! Still more to explore. Thanks!	1
2625	I'm finding more and more uses for this all the time. It keeps me informed with news and weather, I can get a daily Bible verse, and have it play music. New skills are added all the time. The future is here!	1
2626	I love to watch my wife argue with Alexa.  I woke up one night listening to Alexa talking to my cell phone. ????	1
2627	 	1
2628	 	0
2629	Gave as a gift - they loved it.	1
2630	The Echo Dot was everything that I expected and more.	1
2631	I love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier	1
2632	I love my echo dot. Has many features and works great.The only thing I don't like about it, is that I can't play my iMusic on it. I'm going to have to pay for a Spotify or Amazon music account.	1
2633	Its Great. Lots Of Fun!!	1
2634	Easy setup. Alexa needs a lot of training,	1
2635	Third echo dot purchased. Love the product.	1
2636	I like the compact structure of the Dot. The sound is a little too low.	1
2637	"Handy if you don't expect much out of it much ""dumber"" than the assistant in my phone."	1
2638	It's easy to set up and use. There are new features and skills added all the time.	1
2639	Love the product but dislike that I can‚Äôt sync up my Apple Music for Alexa to play	1
2640	Have had for just one week so far and I can say it is a blast to have.	1
2641	love it	1
2642	Works like a charm.	1
2643	Good speaker for bedroom or office	1
2644	Small speaker tin sound. Great with good Bluetooth speaker.	1
2645	Fun and  information.  No dislikes  so far !! Like the convenience!!	1
2646	It was easy to set up and affordable! Love it!	1
2647	I love that I can shut the microphone off at night so my children can‚Äôt talk to it at bed time and she has an automatic sleep timer for their lullaby music. Not sure how I survived with out this for so long.	1
2648	Echo Dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time.	1
2649	The sound quality wasn‚Äôt great, but it was inexpensive	1
2650	Works great... bought it for my shop so that it is like an intercom to the house.	1
2651	It isn‚Äôt bad for what it is. Have issues with it actually playing what I want. Getting it use iHeartRadio properly by playing the station I want is a challenge but it‚Äôs not bad for the sale price I paid.	1
2652	It‚Äôs great but sound quality is very low	1
2653	I love it.	1
2654	As Always, easy to set up	1
2655	It works OK. This speaker quality is not much better than my iPhone X. I would spend the extra money to get the full-size echo which has great sound quality.	1
2656	Very intelligent, love the songs ....	1
2657	Review	1
2658	I love my Echo Dot!  The price I paid during Prime Day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles, but this does so much more.  I can play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on and on.  Definitely worth the money.	1
2659	Sound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.	0
2660	Easy installation and set up. Better sound from the Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified with purchase.	1
2661	I am spoiled by one downstairs...so got this one for upstairs to listen to music , etc. while I walked on the treadmill.	1
2662	 	1
2663	The commands Alexa requires are too specific.  I find Google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what I'm asking for.	1
2664	HANDY AS HELL 10/10 RECOMMEND	1
2665	I am having real difficulty working with the Echo Dot. Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I'm not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I'm not sure&#34;. The music is great and works well for that. All in All so far it's been a very frustrating experience.	0
2666	We are still in the discovery phase, but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed.	1
2667	Totally gets out sense of humour	1
2668	We put one in the bedroom.  It plays music and tells us the weather.  It also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  It is better than a clock radio.  It will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  It can even tell jokes.  I don't know how I got along without it before now.  Amazing.	1
2669	I like the Echo, but not sure about the Dot.  I use it a lot for music and Audio books.The sound quality of this smaller Echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.  I haven't decided if I'll keep it or not!	1
2670	LOVE it. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. We love it.	1
2671	Better sound.	1
2672	Got this for my 2nd Echo in the house, I already have the regular Echo.  The Echo Dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable, wishing I would have just gone with another regular Echo solely based on sound.	1
2673	I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I'd get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.	0
2674	Listens well, does way more than expected, love her!	1
2675	We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won't turn them on but we've been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it's convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I'm just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now.	1
2676	Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions.	1
2677	Small convenient and dependable. This dot is a cutie and Alexa does the job you ask.My only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker	1
2678	Alexa is perfect for people like me living alone. At least I have someone to talk to.. to keep my sanity. üòÇ Though I wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers.	1
2679	small footprint.  nice clarity.	1
2680	Easy set up	1
2681	Great addition to my Alexa base. Using it in my guest bedroom for music, clock and info.Dot speaker is not as strong as the base but it's a great value	1
2682	I had an Alexia built into my thermostat that just didn't work very well. I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.	1
2683	I connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my Google Home mini can't do.  It works well.	1
2684	this is so much fun to play with - I just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off I tell Alexa to turn it of - Alexa learns from the questions I ask. SHe will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. If I wake up in the middle of the night I do not have to turn on a light I just ask alexa what time is it. When I want the current weather she tells me. Ask her what going on in the city she knows. Call a friend she will dial ( I haven't used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.	1
2685	Easy to set up and does everything it‚Äôs a poster. Despite its small size the speakers are adequate. Understands instructions from across the room. Very happy with the purchase.	1
2686	A great product for the price, works well!!	1
2687	Perfect for a home office	1
2688	Weak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it's lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.	0
2689	It does what it's suppose to do great product.	1
2690	I love this item and being able to hear any kind of music.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered another.	1
2691	Love the dot	1
2692	Great item.  I'm so glad I made the purchase and on Prime day.	1
2693	I'm still learning how to use it.  I figured out it can read my kindle books to me, which is a real bonus.	1
2694	Love having one in our bedroom and in the kitchen. Great to drop in on family around the house.	1
2695	So far so good.  Not to tech savvy so, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do with it but, it was easy to set up and so far easy to use.  Lots of apps that it can use.  I will have to play with it some more but its fun to have.	1
2696	Echo Dot responds to us when we aren't even talking to it. I've unplugged it. It feels like it's &#34;spying&#34; on us.	0
2697	NOT CONNECTED TO MY PHONE PLAYLIST :(	0
2698	I had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home. My wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer. This has been a Godsend, 100%. We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We are still learning but I tell you, this is absolutely amazing. I purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on Alexa. With the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. This is well worth the money. You won't regret this at all!	1
2699	Perfect!  Fast shipment and packaging.  Worked as intended.	1
2700	Alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time	1
2701	Love it!	1
2702	I'm addicted to this thing.	1
2703	I love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I'm just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn't take up a whole lot of space.	1
2704	So far all.i can say is I love it	1
2705	Love my dots.  Easy to use.  I have two plus the Echo Spot.  One of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music ... AMAZON, IHeart Radio, Pandora.	1
2706	Great to play music throughout the house. Great and easily fits in my decor of my home	1
2707	I'm obsessed with Alexa. She tells me the weather every morning, she can play games (we love the guess the song one!) and the one we have upstairs can turn off our TV downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if Alexa will do it for you????	1
2708	Works well. Just disappointed with the speaker quality. But hooked it up to old computer speakers.	1
2709	Easy setup, easy use, work with other smart products, always learning what it can do	1
2710	We have so much fun with this!  So easy to use that even my four year old loves talking to Alexa!!	1
2711	I love my new Echo Dot! Right now, I mainly use it to play music at night, but it gets the job done.	1
2712	We love this thing! I wish I would have gotten it sooner. You will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids, but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework. There are loads of skills. I am very happy with this purchase, especially since I got it on prime day for almost half price.	1
2713	Super easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time. It‚Äôs great for my news updates too!	1
2714	It works just like my other Dots.	1
2715	Set up was simple. It recognizes my voice well. It seams very intuitive. I am enjoying its ease of use.	1
2716	The only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.  Which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.Won‚Äôt be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.	0
2717	I was hoping the cord was white also. Otherwise it is fine.	1
2718	I like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list, set and alarm, play any song I can think of and much more. I wish the sound could be a tad louder.	1
2719	Too soon, I'm still learning what I can do with it.	1
2720	Enjoying it and still learning all the commands.  Ran into one frustrating issue.  It was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household.	1
2721	I love the option where u can play music everywhere in the house when you have multiple devices	1
2722	Works great!	1
2723	I like almost everything	1
2724	AMAZING. It has helped me become better organized, gives me traffic updates, weather updates, and helps me maintain a good, fast morning routine.	1
2725	My kids love Alexa... Skills are amazing, would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions	1
2726	Great. Definitely gets a little old after a while but for $30 I can't really regret it at all. Love having it hooked up to my speakers via bluetooth and waking up to The Smiths.	1
2727	Love it. Added it to an upstairs bedroom	1
2728	Got to love Alexa she does everything around our house	1
2729	Works great and easy to set up!	1
2730	My 3rd echo device. Very easy to set up. Works perfectly.	1
2731	Easy to set up and start using.. works as advertised.	1
2732	 	1
2733	Love our little dot. I don‚Äôt know what the original larger Alexa can do that the dot cannot do but we are pleased with our dots capabilities.	1
2734	Really like it	1
2735	Works as expected. This is our fourth one, our son loves it in his room. Easy to set an alarm and he can play music through it.	1
2736	Love it	1
2737	Dislike the volume. It does not sound loud enough.	1
2738	Love Alexa!!  I own 2 and gave one for a gift which was a huge hit!	1
2739	as expected	1
2740	I didn‚Äôt order it	0
2741	I love this technology. I'm older, but this is so easy to set up and use. I have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything I use my echo for which is in the living room.	1
2742	Use as my 3rd dot. Bought so my husband would be able to contact someone if he falls and doesn't have access to phone.	1
2743	Amazing product. Still learnimg all the things it can do	1
2744	Does what I expected, and more.	1
2745	The product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has ... and even that one has Bluetooth and doesn‚Äôt need to be plugged in. The only good thing about this is that you can speak to it.	0
2746	I have a friend now.	1
2747	It‚Äôs easier to do things with it	1
2748	Good device	1
2749	"Overall love it. There are just some commands which aren't effective. It may be part user error or ""Alexa"" becoming accustom to what is being asked."	1
2750	these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts  of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house, lol. we wouldn't be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs.	1
2751	Works great, love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices.	1
2752	I love it, it is just what I thought it would be!!!  I'm addicted!	1
2753	Works beautifully, excellent sound.	1
2754	Still learning everything she can do.  Good for a room.  Volume is pretty good without an additional speaker	1
2755	neat tool we enjoy it with the family	1
2756	Easy to connect and the skills created for our Echo 2nd Gen worked fine with the Dot.	1
2757	I live alone, this is the best companion!	1
2758	Easy to set up and connect with smart devices. Just what I needed!	1
2759	Love it! I personally prefer Spotify music, so it‚Äôs great that I was able to set that as default. There‚Äôs not a day that goes by without music in our home. Also, the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave, so we tell Alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders. He‚Äôs a lot more calmer and doesn‚Äôt bark when we lock the door and start walking away. It‚Äôs a must have!	1
2760	Love it.  It works great.  Alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day.  I'm not an expert but I think the sound quality is fine.  Not perfect but good.	1
2761	This  is my second Echo to purchase -- the price was so cheap -- I'm seriously thinking of buying 2 more -- I use &#34;Alexa&#34; for everything -- it's the next best thing to the internet  :-*	1
2762	I love it. bought one for my daughter and one for myself	1
2763	 	1
2764	It is just not as loud as I thought it was going to be.	1
2765	I enjoy it. Still discovering new uses.	1
2766	Being able to add speakers is a plus. I take it on my deck when I am outside. Just love it. I have my big Alexia in my bedroom	1
2767	excellent device , works great, having no problems or concerns	1
2768	It's pretty fun and nice to have a speaker that responds to my questions but doesn't understand my commands some of the time.	1
2769	 	1
2770	I like the hands free operation vs the Tap. We use both for controlling smart plugs.	1
2771	I dislike that it confuses my requests all the time.	1
2772	 	1
2773	Love my Alexa! Actually have 3 throughout the house. Favorite function is lists. Great for time management and if course, music.	1
2774	This product is easy to use and very entertaining.  I have yet to hook it up to my TV or lights but look forward to doing so.	1
2775	 	1
2776	works great but speaker is not the good for music. Will need to get a Bluetooth speaker.	1
2777	Outstanding product - easy to use.  works great	1
2778	We have six of these throughout our home and they are great.  There are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening.  There should be more options to change the name of the engagement command &#34;Alexa&#34; or &#34;Computer&#34; are a little annoying.  More colors then black and white would also be a good thing.	1
2779	Use the product for music and it‚Äôs great!	1
2780	Easy to set-up and to use.	1
2781	It works great!!	1
2782	I like having more Alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting.	1
2783	PHENOMENAL	1
2784	I loved it does exactly what it says	1
2785	I used it to control my smart home devices. Works great.	1
2786	Very convenient	1
2787	Este producto lleg√≥ y a la semana se qued√≥ sin olor, perdi√≥ toda su escencia, huele solo a alcohol	1
2788	Easy to set up Ready to use in minutes.	1
2789	Barry	1
2790	 	1
2791	My three year old loves it.  Good for doing basic household tasks.  We're going to add a few smart outlets and bulbs.	1
2792	Awesome device wish I bought one ages ago.	1
2793	love it	1
2794	Perfect for kids, adults and everyone in between!!	1
2795	Listening to music, searching locations, checking time, looking up weather. There are many more task to learn. It was simple to set up.	1
2796	I do love these things, i have them running my entire home, TV, all my lights, my thermostat, my front door dead bolt, the cameras... and i love listening to npr. these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek.... I named mine computer to get the feel... but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems.	1
2797	Only complaint I have is that the sound quality isn't great. I mostly use it for commands though, and I have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through. I have a couple friends that have a dot and don't mind the audio quality, but if you're bothered by that kind of thing I'd go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers.	1
2798	Good	1
2799	Nice little unit  no issues	1
2800	The echo dot was easy to set up and use. It helps provide music, etc. to small spaces and was just what I was looking for.	1
2801	I set her up to play through our home theater system. So fat we are just using her for weather forecasts, cooking timers, and we really enjoy the music!	1
2802	Small device that my kids like to ask questions. Very handy friendly interactive	1
2803	beyond awesome	1
2804	I like that it responds every time. It was easy to set up.  I'm still learning what I can do with it. I may like a better speaker more.	1
2805	Family loved it!	1
2806	 	1
2807	I like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the Google. Only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker. Easy to use.	1
2808	Echos are great I have a few of them through out our home .  All in voice range to ask a question. Say a command to turn lights on or off. Or my favorite is play music all though the house.	1
2809	Love it , this time it's a gift  for friend	1
2810	Fantastic product, I use it as a smart home hub and to play music through speakers mainly, the customizable routines are so nice and very easy to program	1
2811	Great	1
2812	I am quite disappointed by this product.There clearly is a bug: half of the time I ask for a newsflash, two second after it starts, the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes. Same goes when I ask to play the radio. Also, many times it get confused when I ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true. Clearly no AI or natural language, very 'beta' stage still for me. Not impressed!	0
2813	Love this thing works great and kids love it to	1
2814	Love it.. makes the simple things in life simpler	1
2815	I am really enjoying the many different features on my Alexa, especially listening to music and audio books	1
2816	Echo Dot is a wonderful invention. We love it. Alexa is so smart.	1
2817	Alarm and music, information the weather	1
2818	Love it! Very helpful	1
2819	Good but it‚Äôs pretty low	1
2820	Alarm, calendar, reminders	1
2821	I have had the echo dot for about two weeks and am having fun with it. I set morning alarms, check the weather, have Alexa play various music (I bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound), and I'm learning her skills. A little tricky to connect to wifi initially, but after some trial and error it connected, and has stayed connected. So far, super satisfied. Will be buying one for my mother and one for my office.	1
2822	I AM COMPLETELY IN LOVE. DOES ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING AND IS SO AMAZING AND GREAT	1
2823	Nope. Still a lot to be improved. For most of the things we ask.. It says.. Hmmmm.. I dont know that.	0
2824	The speaker could be better...	1
2825	I love it!!	1
2826	3rd Dot. Love it!	1
2827	works like any other one!	1
2828	Love my new Alexa. She works great so far.	1
2829	I bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and I was excited when it came in the next day. I set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can't use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It's very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could. If any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know!	1
2830	I got this for dad on father's Day!  He was tickled with it!	1
2831	Nice product	1
2832	Love my echo. Love playing music in my room	1
2833	Still getting used to Alexa, but I think she's a keeper!	1
2834	Works good for the most part. You ask it some questions and she says she doesn‚Äôt know. I thought she was supposed to know everything	1
2835	my new best friend :)	1
2836	Absolutely love it!!!!	1
2837	I liked linking two more rooms in the home	1
2838	I LOVE ALEXA!! SHE ROCKS!!!	1
2839	I had some trouble with my echo dot when I first got it because of internet connection issues. After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it's little rough patch and I haven't had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device.	1
2840	Small size works great in our sunroom.	1
2841	I like it and it‚Äôs helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon.	1
2842	I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for.	0
2843	It won‚Äôt work as a blue tooth speaker with my tv,it connects but won‚Äôt work	1
2844	I've only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time I did use it. It was fun trying to use Alexa	1
2845	This was an impulse buy but turns out I really enjoy my new dot. My grands love requesting songs and playing games. I like listening to my audible selection, keeping up with my to do lists and discovering new Alexa skills. Fun and practical, my echo dot has been a surprisingly welcome addition to my home.	1
2846	Great product at a great price.	1
2847	My son loves his Echo Dot.	1
2848	Love these.  Great in the bathroom to listen to the news during showering.  Or listen to CNN live with Serius SM.	1
2849	I like it alot. I connected it so I can play my Pandora and I asked about the weather & time every morning. I got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because I can have my music play Unlimited on this. I'm going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once I get more comfortable with it. Definitely worth the money.	1
2850	It plays music that I request.	1
2851	I didn't like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.	0
2852	Luv it.  It's a great product.	1
2853	What can I say. Well, I‚Äôm a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that‚Äôs not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.	1
2854	Great product	1
2855	Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely.	1
2856	Easy to set up, can control Kasa smart plugs no problem.  Even the kids have figured stuff out that I would not have asked Alexa, like telling jokes and singing. The Alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam.	1
2857	I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don't like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. Lol	1
2858	Alarm,bed time story, universal	1
2859	I am in love with alexa	1
2860	Its was easy to set up	1
2861	 	1
2862	Works better than anticipated. This thing is awesome.	1
2863	Great product	1
2864	Really like it	1
2865	I like that it respond most of my comands. Great product.	1
2866	The volume is very low	0
2867	so far i am liking it although i am probably not using it to the full capasity	1
2868	My new best friend!! I'm a little behind the times I've never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. I use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. I use it for my amazon audible books. Set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. Have her tell me a short story lol. It's pretty fun. I know some people complained about the speaker I'm not sure why. I'm sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough. But I rent a room and in my bedroom it's perfect I don't have any problems with the speaker. Love everything about it!	1
2869	Wish volume was capable of going louder	1
2870	I love it	1
2871	Best purchase this year.	1
2872	I love these, I have 2 dots and one echo. For a medium size rooms these are loud enough without external speakers although I do use external for the dots.	1
2873	I really love my dots! So awesome how it‚Äôs connects all my rooms. But like you‚Äôve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. Which I‚Äôm sure if I connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. But as a stand alone the volume is just ok. Definitely not like my tall echo. And the dots don‚Äôt pick up voice as good as my tall echo.Still totally love them and would recommend 100%	1
2874	its okay but keeps dropping wifi!	1
2875	Kids love it! I love it!	1
2876	 	0
2877	Love my echo dot easy to use and set up	1
2878	love it as I do all of my echos	1
2879	Excellent product !!	1
2880	I love being able to control lights, doors and music.	1
2881	Fun To interact with	1
2882	Very satisfied with the product	1
2883	We have 3 echos now, even one in the barn, great idea for when I am working with my horse, can still get news flashes & my music!	1
2884	I bought this for my healing room.  I play continuous spa like music. Although Alexa knows the type of music needed, the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled.  I didn't know I had to buy speakers too.	1
2885	Like having the music where ever I am.	1
2886	Hard to hear, had to blue tooth it to a better speaker.	1
2887	No problems, works as expected. Could have a better speaker.	1
2888	I love it...... I want to get another one very  very  soon	1
2889	Great to have along with the Echo	1
2890	this is my 2nd echo dot and it is working just as i want it to.  i have it in the bedroom and i par it with a small blue tooth speaker.  last nite i went to sleep with sounds of a thunderstorm as provided by my echo dot.  i am planning to have the dot turn my bedroom lamps on when i receive the smart plugs that i ordered.	1
2891	daughter wanted a white boombox, nothing good out for 11 yr old.  decided to go echo dot for most any request + white BT good speaker.  she loved the gift and nice option for many things on the internet.	1
2892	Cheap and cheap sound.	0
2893	This is pretty cool	1
2894	Some times Alexa is a little &#34;thick&#34;, but mostly good!	1
2895	Love it!! Don‚Äôt know what took me so long to get one ‚Äî and don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt get two on Amazon Prime Day!	1
2896	Up dated news	1
2897	Works like a champ.	1
2898	Clear sound, great alarm clock, plays my music.  What else can you ask for.  Oh yeah, you can order what you need.	1
2899	Love that you can use your cell phone to call Echo or Dot. You can also use Echo and Dot as intercoms.	1
2900	love it...just like the other 4 I own.	1
2901	Great price.  I love my echo dot,	1
2902	Excellent. Bought another one yesterday!	1
2903	works great	1
2904	Love this!!! My daughter enjoys telling Alexa what to do. Haha	1
2905	Purchased this for a discount on Prime Day to insert into a portable Bluetooth speaker made specifically to work with Echo Dot. Works great, love it! Now I can bring Alexa out onto the patio with me, and I mostly use it for music. This is our 3rd Echo product and we love them!	1
2906	Just got my third one. Love them	1
2907	The ease in installing	1
2908	Un excelente equipo inteligente al estar conectado al internet nos provee de m√∫ltiples funciones tales como, el tiempo,hora,informaci√≥n de cualquier estudio que est√©s realizando atr√°s vez del internet.	1
2909	For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn‚Äôt know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don‚Äôt like that it‚Äôs not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don‚Äôt. Lastly, I‚Äôm sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven‚Äôt quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù.	0
2910	I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don't like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it's an ok item.	1
2911	Love the echo dot it‚Äôs amaxing!!!	1
2912	I like to use it for listening to podcasts.  I like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what's new.  The one thing I don't like was getting it to recognize the radio station I wanted to listen to.  I finally got it working, but had to work through the bugs.	1
2913	Just like it's big sister, the Echo, only smaller, with slightly less audio fidelity, but much lower price (on amazon prime day:-)Used in another room to add Alexa to an additional room.	1
2914	It does everything  the big guy does	1
2915	Great product - understands my accent!	1
2916	Love it... can't stop using it..	1
2917	Really like the availability to get instant music throughout the house.	1
2918	 	1
2919	very handy in the kitchen, sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps.	1
2920	Cool little speaker..I love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great!!	1
2921	It is s great tool helping with information.	1
2922	Used twice not working!!!!!!!	0
2923	Awesome piece of technology that has simplified my life. Great purchase.	1
2924	I jumped on the bandwagon by purchasing an Echo.  I feel like there was a struggle getting connected and then three days later, the device is sharing news and weather.  Now we use it some, but have not tapped in to all options.  Still testing it out.	1
2925	Love Alexa. Love the Echo Dot but we have trouble with the speakers when using the intercom.	1
2926	Love it , Now if I can only find the correct smart (links)Plug to connect this too	1
2927	Work pretty well	1
2928	Still learning it	1
2929	We really love our Echo Dot, we can get questions answered right away and play any music we can think of.	1
2930	Usual reliable Alexa	1
2931	Speaker could be better qualty	1
2932	This device does not interact with my home filled with Apple devices.  How disappointing!	0
2933	Have the echo wanted something smaller in another room  they work together great	1
2934	Love it!! It is so handy and easy to use. Got it for my classroom, but I many need to just get another one.	1
2935	Very pleased	1
2936	Primarily for music in our bedroom.  I wish the speaker had better fidelity.	1
2937	Nice	1
2938	Music, weather, time.	1
2939	Great, love it!	1
2940	Not all that happy. The speaker isn‚Äôt great and for some reason a lot of times when I play music it will start to make some weird noise and just stop. My son has a google home and it is much better	0
2941	Not impressed	1
2942	I really like it .	1
2943	it takes a while to learn the uses and I'm still learning!	1
2944	Alexa is phenomenal!	1
2945	When you think about it this really doesn‚Äôt do much. Play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. I can see why price is dropping like a rock.	0
2946	The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it's not awkward, and it doesn't take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing.	1
2947	I use the echo dot several different ways in my home. I use it downstairs to control lighting. I also take it out on my deck to stream music to a Bluetooth speaker. It works great for what I need.	1
2948	I have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom. It was even easier to set up than my original echo.	1
2949	Makes turning on and off things in the house so simple. Great for little updates as well, like checking the weather and such.	1
2950	Great product, fun to use!!	1
2951	Needs to be smarter	1
2952	I really enjoy being able to just make a request  for my favorite music and it happens I have no complaints at this time...	1
2953	Love it. Works great making my home a smarthome	1
2954	I really like the echo dot. It‚Äôs amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot.	1
2955	Convenient and fun.	1
2956	It's alright....	1
2957	this is my first Alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation!	1
2958	I love searching the Alexa skill shop on the app. Useful things like having Alexa turn my lights on and off, listening to news updates every morning. And fun stuff like telling Alexa to make the Star Trek red alert nois. Or playing song quiz with friends.	1
2959	Second dot.	1
2960	Son loves it.	1
2961	I love how compact it is.	1
2962	This worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet (wifi) and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked.  Amazon customer service couldn't help further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, so they weren't willing to replace.	0
2963	It talks to me, plays the type of music i want to listen to, and even turns off when I ask if to.	1
2964	Ask it to play Motown radio on Pandora and it keeps asking if I want to add a salsa station. Motown isn‚Äôt close to salsa phonetically.	0
2965	Love it, we are still learning the capabilities, having a lot of fun.	1
2966	Easy to set up. Still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug. Grandkids think Alex is cool!	1
2967	I love it! I use it for everything. It‚Äôs a part of my daily routine	1
2968	The Alexa program is great, but the quality is not the best. It could definitely be louder.	1
2969	Overall I like this. Though Siri on my phone can do more for what I need as I don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù and don‚Äôt intend to make it one. But it‚Äôs fun and I use it for music and to have it read me my audible books.	1
2970	Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn't work.	1
2971	Set up is so easy.	1
2972	Love it	1
2973	I'm amazed with the alarm. I tell Alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does.  I love the play list if music. Not sure if i don't keep prime if music will still be available. However i did love the fact Amazon gave me music free for 3 months...they should have given prime free for 3 months as well.	1
2974	I love all of the things that it can do. I can play with it and learn from it.	1
2975	Been debating on getting one, but am happy I did! Still more to explore. Thanks!	1
2976	I'm finding more and more uses for this all the time. It keeps me informed with news and weather, I can get a daily Bible verse, and have it play music. New skills are added all the time. The future is here!	1
2977	I love to watch my wife argue with Alexa.  I woke up one night listening to Alexa talking to my cell phone. ????	1
2978	 	1
2979	 	0
2980	Gave as a gift - they loved it.	1
2981	The Echo Dot was everything that I expected and more.	1
2982	I love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier	1
2983	I love my echo dot. Has many features and works great.The only thing I don't like about it, is that I can't play my iMusic on it. I'm going to have to pay for a Spotify or Amazon music account.	1
2984	Its Great. Lots Of Fun!!	1
2985	Easy setup. Alexa needs a lot of training,	1
2986	Third echo dot purchased. Love the product.	1
2987	I like the compact structure of the Dot. The sound is a little too low.	1
2988	"Handy if you don't expect much out of it much ""dumber"" than the assistant in my phone."	1
2989	It's easy to set up and use. There are new features and skills added all the time.	1
2990	Love the product but dislike that I can‚Äôt sync up my Apple Music for Alexa to play	1
2991	Have had for just one week so far and I can say it is a blast to have.	1
2992	love it	1
2993	Works like a charm.	1
2994	Good speaker for bedroom or office	1
2995	Small speaker tin sound. Great with good Bluetooth speaker.	1
2996	Fun and  information.  No dislikes  so far !! Like the convenience!!	1
2997	It was easy to set up and affordable! Love it!	1
2998	I love that I can shut the microphone off at night so my children can‚Äôt talk to it at bed time and she has an automatic sleep timer for their lullaby music. Not sure how I survived with out this for so long.	1
2999	Echo Dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time.	1
3000	The sound quality wasn‚Äôt great, but it was inexpensive	1
3001	Works great... bought it for my shop so that it is like an intercom to the house.	1
3002	It isn‚Äôt bad for what it is. Have issues with it actually playing what I want. Getting it use iHeartRadio properly by playing the station I want is a challenge but it‚Äôs not bad for the sale price I paid.	1
3003	It‚Äôs great but sound quality is very low	1
3004	I love it.	1
3005	As Always, easy to set up	1
3006	It works OK. This speaker quality is not much better than my iPhone X. I would spend the extra money to get the full-size echo which has great sound quality.	1
3007	Very intelligent, love the songs ....	1
3008	Review	1
3009	I love my Echo Dot!  The price I paid during Prime Day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles, but this does so much more.  I can play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on and on.  Definitely worth the money.	1
3010	Sound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.	0
3011	Easy installation and set up. Better sound from the Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified with purchase.	1
3012	I am spoiled by one downstairs...so got this one for upstairs to listen to music , etc. while I walked on the treadmill.	1
3013	 	1
3014	The commands Alexa requires are too specific.  I find Google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what I'm asking for.	1
3015	HANDY AS HELL 10/10 RECOMMEND	1
3016	I am having real difficulty working with the Echo Dot. Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I'm not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I'm not sure&#34;. The music is great and works well for that. All in All so far it's been a very frustrating experience.	0
3017	We are still in the discovery phase, but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed.	1
3018	Totally gets out sense of humour	1
3019	We put one in the bedroom.  It plays music and tells us the weather.  It also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  It is better than a clock radio.  It will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  It can even tell jokes.  I don't know how I got along without it before now.  Amazing.	1
3020	I like the Echo, but not sure about the Dot.  I use it a lot for music and Audio books.The sound quality of this smaller Echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.  I haven't decided if I'll keep it or not!	1
3021	LOVE it. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. We love it.	1
3022	Better sound.	1
3023	Got this for my 2nd Echo in the house, I already have the regular Echo.  The Echo Dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable, wishing I would have just gone with another regular Echo solely based on sound.	1
3024	I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I'd get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.	0
3025	Listens well, does way more than expected, love her!	1
3026	We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won't turn them on but we've been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it's convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I'm just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now.	1
3027	Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions.	1
3028	Small convenient and dependable. This dot is a cutie and Alexa does the job you ask.My only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker	1
3029	Alexa is perfect for people like me living alone. At least I have someone to talk to.. to keep my sanity. üòÇ Though I wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers.	1
3030	small footprint.  nice clarity.	1
3031	Easy set up	1
3032	Great addition to my Alexa base. Using it in my guest bedroom for music, clock and info.Dot speaker is not as strong as the base but it's a great value	1
3033	I had an Alexia built into my thermostat that just didn't work very well. I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.	1
3034	I connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my Google Home mini can't do.  It works well.	1
3035	this is so much fun to play with - I just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off I tell Alexa to turn it of - Alexa learns from the questions I ask. SHe will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. If I wake up in the middle of the night I do not have to turn on a light I just ask alexa what time is it. When I want the current weather she tells me. Ask her what going on in the city she knows. Call a friend she will dial ( I haven't used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.	1
3036	Easy to set up and does everything it‚Äôs a poster. Despite its small size the speakers are adequate. Understands instructions from across the room. Very happy with the purchase.	1
3037	A great product for the price, works well!!	1
3038	Perfect for a home office	1
3039	Weak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it's lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.	0
3040	It does what it's suppose to do great product.	1
3041	I love this item and being able to hear any kind of music.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered another.	1
3042	Love the dot	1
3043	Great item.  I'm so glad I made the purchase and on Prime day.	1
3044	I'm still learning how to use it.  I figured out it can read my kindle books to me, which is a real bonus.	1
3045	Love having one in our bedroom and in the kitchen. Great to drop in on family around the house.	1
3046	So far so good.  Not to tech savvy so, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do with it but, it was easy to set up and so far easy to use.  Lots of apps that it can use.  I will have to play with it some more but its fun to have.	1
3047	Echo Dot responds to us when we aren't even talking to it. I've unplugged it. It feels like it's &#34;spying&#34; on us.	0
3048	NOT CONNECTED TO MY PHONE PLAYLIST :(	0
3049	I had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home. My wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer. This has been a Godsend, 100%. We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We are still learning but I tell you, this is absolutely amazing. I purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on Alexa. With the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. This is well worth the money. You won't regret this at all!	1
3050	Perfect!  Fast shipment and packaging.  Worked as intended.	1
3051	Alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time	1
3052	Love it!	1
3053	I'm addicted to this thing.	1
3054	I love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I'm just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn't take up a whole lot of space.	1
3055	So far all.i can say is I love it	1
3056	Love my dots.  Easy to use.  I have two plus the Echo Spot.  One of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music ... AMAZON, IHeart Radio, Pandora.	1
3057	Great to play music throughout the house. Great and easily fits in my decor of my home	1
3058	I'm obsessed with Alexa. She tells me the weather every morning, she can play games (we love the guess the song one!) and the one we have upstairs can turn off our TV downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if Alexa will do it for you????	1
3059	Works well. Just disappointed with the speaker quality. But hooked it up to old computer speakers.	1
3060	Easy setup, easy use, work with other smart products, always learning what it can do	1
3061	We have so much fun with this!  So easy to use that even my four year old loves talking to Alexa!!	1
3062	I love my new Echo Dot! Right now, I mainly use it to play music at night, but it gets the job done.	1
3063	We love this thing! I wish I would have gotten it sooner. You will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids, but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework. There are loads of skills. I am very happy with this purchase, especially since I got it on prime day for almost half price.	1
3064	Super easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time. It‚Äôs great for my news updates too!	1
3065	It works just like my other Dots.	1
3066	Set up was simple. It recognizes my voice well. It seams very intuitive. I am enjoying its ease of use.	1
3067	The only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.  Which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.Won‚Äôt be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.	0
3068	I was hoping the cord was white also. Otherwise it is fine.	1
3069	I like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list, set and alarm, play any song I can think of and much more. I wish the sound could be a tad louder.	1
3070	Too soon, I'm still learning what I can do with it.	1
3071	Enjoying it and still learning all the commands.  Ran into one frustrating issue.  It was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household.	1
3072	I love the option where u can play music everywhere in the house when you have multiple devices	1
3073	Works great!	1
3074	I like almost everything	1
3075	AMAZING. It has helped me become better organized, gives me traffic updates, weather updates, and helps me maintain a good, fast morning routine.	1
3076	My kids love Alexa... Skills are amazing, would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions	1
3077	Great. Definitely gets a little old after a while but for $30 I can't really regret it at all. Love having it hooked up to my speakers via bluetooth and waking up to The Smiths.	1
3078	Love it. Added it to an upstairs bedroom	1
3079	Got to love Alexa she does everything around our house	1
3080	Works great and easy to set up!	1
3081	My 3rd echo device. Very easy to set up. Works perfectly.	1
3082	Easy to set up and start using.. works as advertised.	1
3083	 	1
3084	Love our little dot. I don‚Äôt know what the original larger Alexa can do that the dot cannot do but we are pleased with our dots capabilities.	1
3085	Really like it	1
3086	Works as expected. This is our fourth one, our son loves it in his room. Easy to set an alarm and he can play music through it.	1
3087	Love it	1
3088	Dislike the volume. It does not sound loud enough.	1
3089	Love Alexa!!  I own 2 and gave one for a gift which was a huge hit!	1
3090	as expected	1
3091	I didn‚Äôt order it	0
3092	I love this technology. I'm older, but this is so easy to set up and use. I have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything I use my echo for which is in the living room.	1
3093	Use as my 3rd dot. Bought so my husband would be able to contact someone if he falls and doesn't have access to phone.	1
3094	Amazing product. Still learnimg all the things it can do	1
3095	Does what I expected, and more.	1
3096	The product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has ... and even that one has Bluetooth and doesn‚Äôt need to be plugged in. The only good thing about this is that you can speak to it.	0
3097	I have a friend now.	1
3098	It‚Äôs easier to do things with it	1
3099	Good device	1
3100	"Overall love it. There are just some commands which aren't effective. It may be part user error or ""Alexa"" becoming accustom to what is being asked."	1
3101	these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts  of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house, lol. we wouldn't be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs.	1
3102	Works great, love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices.	1
3103	I love it, it is just what I thought it would be!!!  I'm addicted!	1
3104	Works beautifully, excellent sound.	1
3105	Still learning everything she can do.  Good for a room.  Volume is pretty good without an additional speaker	1
3106	neat tool we enjoy it with the family	1
3107	Easy to connect and the skills created for our Echo 2nd Gen worked fine with the Dot.	1
3108	I live alone, this is the best companion!	1
3109	Easy to set up and connect with smart devices. Just what I needed!	1
3110	Love it! I personally prefer Spotify music, so it‚Äôs great that I was able to set that as default. There‚Äôs not a day that goes by without music in our home. Also, the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave, so we tell Alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders. He‚Äôs a lot more calmer and doesn‚Äôt bark when we lock the door and start walking away. It‚Äôs a must have!	1
3111	Love it.  It works great.  Alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day.  I'm not an expert but I think the sound quality is fine.  Not perfect but good.	1
3112	This  is my second Echo to purchase -- the price was so cheap -- I'm seriously thinking of buying 2 more -- I use &#34;Alexa&#34; for everything -- it's the next best thing to the internet  :-*	1
3113	I love it. bought one for my daughter and one for myself	1
3114	 	1
3115	It is just not as loud as I thought it was going to be.	1
3116	I enjoy it. Still discovering new uses.	1
3117	Being able to add speakers is a plus. I take it on my deck when I am outside. Just love it. I have my big Alexia in my bedroom	1
3118	excellent device , works great, having no problems or concerns	1
3119	It's pretty fun and nice to have a speaker that responds to my questions but doesn't understand my commands some of the time.	1
3120	 	1
3121	I like the hands free operation vs the Tap. We use both for controlling smart plugs.	1
3122	I dislike that it confuses my requests all the time.	1
3123	 	1
3124	Love my Alexa! Actually have 3 throughout the house. Favorite function is lists. Great for time management and if course, music.	1
3125	This product is easy to use and very entertaining.  I have yet to hook it up to my TV or lights but look forward to doing so.	1
3126	 	1
3127	works great but speaker is not the good for music. Will need to get a Bluetooth speaker.	1
3128	Outstanding product - easy to use.  works great	1
3129	We have six of these throughout our home and they are great.  There are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening.  There should be more options to change the name of the engagement command &#34;Alexa&#34; or &#34;Computer&#34; are a little annoying.  More colors then black and white would also be a good thing.	1
3130	Use the product for music and it‚Äôs great!	1
3131	Easy to set-up and to use.	1
3132	It works great!!	1
3133	I like having more Alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting.	1
3134	PHENOMENAL	1
3135	I loved it does exactly what it says	1
3136	I used it to control my smart home devices. Works great.	1
3137	Very convenient	1
3138	Este producto lleg√≥ y a la semana se qued√≥ sin olor, perdi√≥ toda su escencia, huele solo a alcohol	1
3139	Easy to set up Ready to use in minutes.	1
3140	Barry	1
3141	 	1
3142	My three year old loves it.  Good for doing basic household tasks.  We're going to add a few smart outlets and bulbs.	1
3143	Awesome device wish I bought one ages ago.	1
3144	love it	1
3145	Perfect for kids, adults and everyone in between!!	1
3146	Listening to music, searching locations, checking time, looking up weather. There are many more task to learn. It was simple to set up.	1
3147	I do love these things, i have them running my entire home, TV, all my lights, my thermostat, my front door dead bolt, the cameras... and i love listening to npr. these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek.... I named mine computer to get the feel... but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems.	1
3148	Only complaint I have is that the sound quality isn't great. I mostly use it for commands though, and I have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through. I have a couple friends that have a dot and don't mind the audio quality, but if you're bothered by that kind of thing I'd go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers.	1
3149	Good	1
